# Where are we?

- Described general linear model
- Derived estimators and their distributions
  - $\hat{\symbf{\beta}} = (\symbf{X}'\symbf{X})^{-1}\symbf{X}'\symbf{Y}$
    - Distributed $\mathcal{N}(\symbf{\beta}, \sigma^2(\symbf{X}'\symbf{X})^{-1})$
  - $\hat{\sigma}^2_{\mathrm{unbiased}}=s^2= \frac{1}{n - k} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ (unbiased estimator)
    - $\frac{(n - k)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-k}$

# We therefore have estimates. What's the problem?

# Problem: Uncertainty in Estimation

- We have point estimates for the coefficients and $\sigma^2$.
- However, they are merely estimates, and to make well-informed decisions, we need to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates.
- There are two questions regarding uncertainty we can answer to aid decision-making:
  - What are plausible values for the regression coefficients?
    - Tool: Confidence intervals
  - Is our data compatible with there being no effect of the explanatory variable(s)?
    - Tool: Hypothesis tests

# Note re running code

- Run the following code chunk to load the necessary libraries and functions, if you want to run the code in the slides:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
theme_cowplot_bg <- function(font_size = 14) {
  cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = font_size) +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")
  )
}
```

# Example: Advertising dataset {.smaller}

- Consider our simulated advertising dataset, where we want to know the effect of radio and tv advertising on revenue:

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

```{r}
set.seed(201)
spend_vec_radio <- runif(1e2, 0, 3)
spend_vec_tv <- spend_vec_radio *
  1.2 + runif(1e2, 0, 3)
revenue_vec <- spend_vec_tv * 2 +
  rnorm(1e2, mean = 10, sd = 2)
ad_tbl <- tibble::tibble(
  spend_radio = spend_vec_radio,
  spend_tv = spend_vec_tv,
  revenue = revenue_vec
)
```

# Confidence intervals for fitted values {.smaller}

- Now, let's obtain confidence interval for the fitted value $\hat{y}_i$ at a specific value of radio spend, across a range of TV spend values:

```{r}
#| echo: true
tv_spend <- seq(min(ad_tbl$spend_tv),
  max(ad_tbl$spend_tv), length.out = 1e3)
confint_fitted <- predict(
  fit,
  newdata = data.frame(
    spend_radio = mean(ad_tbl$spend_radio), spend_tv = tv_spend
    ),
  interval = "confidence"
)
head(cbind(tv_spend, confint_fitted) |> signif(4))
```

# Confidence intervals for linear combinations of the regression coefficients

- Quantities of interest are often linear combinations of the regression coefficients.
- For example, suppose that $\symbf{\beta}' = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2)'$ are the regression coefficients.
- We might be interested in confidence intervals for the following two quantities, which can be represented as linear combinations of the regression coefficients:
  - $\beta_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \symbf{\beta}$
  - Fitted value, given that $\symbf{x}_{[i]}' = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_{i1} & x_{i2} \end{pmatrix}'$:
    - $\hat{y}_i = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_{i1} & x_{i2} \end{pmatrix} \symbf{\beta} = \symbf{x}_{[i]}'\symbf{\beta}$

# We already know their distribution, right? {.smaller}

- In general, we express such combinations as $\ell' \symbf{\beta}$, for $\ell$ a column vector with the same number of elements as $\symbf{\beta}$.
- Since $\hat{\symbf{\beta}}$ is normally distributed, any linear combination of $\hat{\symbf{\beta}}$ is also normally distributed.
- Then, we have that

$$
\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\ell' \symbf{\beta}, \sigma^2 \ell' (\symbf{X}'\symbf{X})^{-1} \ell)
$$

- From which we can get the $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval as

$$
\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\sigma^2 \ell' (\symbf{X}'\symbf{X})^{-1} \ell}
$$

\pause

- But we don't know $\sigma^2$! Simply plugging it in will lead to confidence intervals that are too narrow.

# Simulation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}


- In the advertising dataset, $\symbf{\beta}_{\mathrm{TV}}=2$ and $\sigma^2=4$.
- Using the previous results, we can work out that $\hat{\beta}_{\mathrm{TV}} \sim \mathcal{N}(2, 0.16)$.
- A 95% confidence interval is then given by $2 \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{0.16} = \left(1.216, 2.874\right)$.

- If our confidence intervals are valid, then they should contain the true value of $\beta_{\mathrm{TV}}$ 95% of the time.
- However, if we estimate $\sigma^2$ from the data and simply plug that into the normal-distribution based confidence interval, we obtain a lower coverage than 95%.

# Simulation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

- First we calculate $C_{33}=(\symbf{X}'\symbf{X})^{-1}_{33}$, which is a factor in the variance of $\hat{\beta}_{\mathrm{TV}}$.

```{r}
# use only first 10 rows to exaggerate the effect
ad_tbl_few_x <- ad_tbl[1:10, 1:2]
# get design matrix contribution to se of beta_tv
design_matrix <- matrix(
  c(rep(1, 10), ad_tbl_few_x |> unlist()), ncol = 3
)
C_mat <- solve(t(design_matrix) %*% design_matrix)
C_mat_33 <- C_mat[3, 3]
```

# Simulation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

- Now, we simulate the coverage of the confidence interval for $\beta_{\mathrm{TV}}$:

```{r}
set.seed(3)
beta_tv_contained_z <- replicate(1e4, {
  # simulate response, and then fit model
  sim_tbl <- ad_tbl_few_x |>
    dplyr::mutate(
      revenue = spend_tv * 2 + rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
    )
  fit <- lm(revenue ~ spend_radio + spend_tv, data = sim_tbl)
  # plug estimated sigma into standard normal-based confidence interval
  confint_vec <- coef(fit)[[3]] +
    c(-1, 1) * qnorm(0.975) * summary(fit)$sigma * sqrt(C_mat_33)
  # check if true value is contained
  2 > confint_vec[1] & 2 < confint_vec[2]
})
```

# Simulation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

We find that the coverage is...

```{r}
signif(mean(beta_tv_contained_z) * 1e2, 4)
```

# Obtaining a valid confidence interval

- To obtain a valid confidence interval, we need to adjust for the uncertainty in estimating $\sigma^2$.
- We obtain a test statistic that does not include $\sigma^2$, and find its distribution.
- To do so, we divide by $\sqrt{\frac{(n - k)s^2}{\sigma^2}}$ to obtain what looks like a $t$-distributed random variable.
- First, we note that a $t_f$-distributed random variable can be expressed as

$$
\frac{Z}{\sqrt{V/f}}
$$

where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and $V \sim \chi^2_{f}$ are independent.

# Obtaining a valid confidence interval

- We then have that

$$
\frac{\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} - \ell' \symbf{\beta}}{\sigma \sqrt{\ell' \symbf{C} \ell}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \symbf{I})
$$

- Since $\frac{(n - k)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-k}$, we have that

$$
\frac{\frac{\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} - \ell' \symbf{\beta}}{\sigma \sqrt{\ell' \symbf{C} \ell}}}{\sqrt{\frac{(n - k)s^2}{\sigma^2(n-k)}}} 
=
\frac{\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} - \ell' \symbf{\beta}}{s\sqrt{\ell' \symbf{C} \ell}}
$$

- appears to be $t_{n-k}$-distributed.
- However, we need to show that the numerator and denominator are independent.

# Independence of $\hat{\symbf{\beta}}$ and $s^2$

- See theorems 6 and 10 in `SlidesRegW3S1AdditionalProofs.qmd` for the proof.

# Example highlighting the importance of independence

- Suppose we construct the following silly attempt at a $t$ statistic:
  - Let $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$
  - We then need some $V \sim \chi^2_1$. $Z^2$ is $\chi^2_1$-distributed, so let's pick it!
  - Then we have that $T = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{Z^2}} = \frac{Z}{|Z|} = \text{sign}(Z)$, which takes values -1 or 1 and is clearly not $\chi^2_1$ distributed.

# Confidence intervals for quantities of interest

- We can now obtain confidence intervals for $\hat{\beta}_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$:
  - $\hat{\beta}_i: \beta_i \in \hat{\beta}_i \pm t_{\alpha/2} s \sqrt{C_{(i+1)(i+1)}}$
    - Set $\ell = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 & \ldots & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, where $i+1$th entry is 1.
    - Note: We use i+1 instead of i as typically the first index corresponds to the intercept, $\beta_0$. 
  - $\hat{y}_i: y_i \in \hat{y}_i \pm t_{\alpha/2} s \sqrt{\symbf{x}_{[i]}' \symbf{C} \symbf{x}_{[i]}}$
    - Set $\ell = \symbf{x}_{[i]}$, for $\symbf{x}_{[i]}'$ the $i$th row of the design matrix.

# Simulation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

- To demonstrate the improved coverage of the confidence interval for $\beta_{\mathrm{TV}}$, we re-simulate:

```{r}
set.seed(3)
beta_tv_contained_t <- replicate(1e3, {
  # simulate response, and then fit model
  sim_tbl <- ad_tbl_few_x |>
    dplyr::mutate(
      revenue = spend_tv * 2 + rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
    )
  fit <- lm(revenue ~ spend_tv + spend_radio, data = sim_tbl)
  # plug estimated sigma into standard normal-based confidence interval
  confint_vec <- coef(fit)[[2]] +
    c(-1, 1) * qt(0.975, 10 - 3) * summary(fit)$sigma * sqrt(C_mat_33)
  # check if true value is contained
  2 > confint_vec[1] & 2 < confint_vec[2]
})
```

# Simulation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

- We find that the coverage is...

```{r}
signif(mean(beta_tv_contained_t) * 1e2, 4)
```

- It would get closer and closer to 95 as the number of samples taken increased.

# Exact calculation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

- Of course, the confidence interval using the $t$-statistic is exact.
- However, we can now calculate the coverage of the $z$-statistic.
- Now that we know the distribution of $\frac{\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} - \ell' \symbf{\beta}}{s\sqrt{\ell' \symbf{C} \ell}}$, we can work out the actual coverage of the incorrect confidence interval:
- The coverage is given by

$$
P(z^{\alpha/2} < \frac{\ell' \hat{\symbf{\beta}} - \ell' \symbf{\beta}}{s\sqrt{\ell' \symbf{C} \ell}} < z^{1-\alpha/2}) = P(z^{\alpha/2} < t_{n-k} < z^{1-\alpha/2}).
$$

# Exact calculation: coverage of confidence interval {.smaller}

- Using `R` to compute this when $n=10$, $k=3$ and $\alpha = 0.05$:

```{r}
# probability of being less than z^{0.975}:
p_lt_0975 <- pt(qnorm(0.975), 10 - 3)
# probability of being less than z^0.025:
p_lt_0025 <- pt(qnorm(0.025), 10 - 3)
# differnce between the two
((p_lt_0975 - p_lt_0025) * 1e2) |> signif(3)
```

- This is similar to the simulated value (`r signif(mean(beta_tv_contained_z) * 1e2, 4)`).

# Interpreting Confidence Interval

- A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter being estimated (e.g., regression coefficients).
- *Individual regression parameters*: If the confidence interval includes zero, it means that no relationship is plausible
- *Fited values*: Confidence interval represents uncertainty in predicting the average response for given predictor values.
- One may comment on whether the confidence interval is narrow or wide, with exactly what this means depending on the context.

# Reporting Confidence Intervals

- When discussing the estimated effect of a parameter in the text of your report, include the confidence interval, e.g. "The estimated effect of TV advertising on sales is 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), suggesting a positive impact".
- Often, the level ("95%") is omitted if it is the standard 95% level. In addition, if you specify somewhere in the text that the values in brackets are the confidence interval, you can omit the "CI" part, too.

# Limitations

- Confidence intervals do not imply the probability that the true parameter lies within the interval (i.e., it's not "the probability that $\beta$ is in the interval").
  - $\beta$ is fixed, so it either lies in the interval or it doesn't!
- The inference is only as good as the model assumptions, so always check the validity of the underlying assumptions (we'll get to this).
