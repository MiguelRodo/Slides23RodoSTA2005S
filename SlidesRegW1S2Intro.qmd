# Notes from last year's tutors 

- Learning to code up analyses is perhaps the most useful part of the course.
- Don't underestimate the course - passing STA2004F is great, but this is a lot of content. Marks are often terrible. 
- Be wary of the assignments - they count as much as the tests, and take a long time. 
- The exam counts 70%, so don't presume that assignments and tests will carry you through. Focus on understanding the content.
- Questions to rehearse proofs are free marks. 
- Experimental design in term four tends to be more difficult, so bank regression marks.

# For the remainder of this lecture

- Introductory code example of a linear regression

# Regression section outline

- **Week one**: statistical and mathematical prerequisites (statistical distributions and linear algebra), and useful proofs regarding the multivariate normal distribution
- **Week two**: General linear model introduction (formulation, estimation and parameter distributions)
- **Week three**: General linear model inference (confidence intervals and hypothesis testing)
- **Week four**: ANOVA and model checking
- **Week five**: Variable selection, Gauss-Markov theorem and data transformation
- **Week six**: PCA and bootstrapping
