### What is regression?

- In terms of notation, what is the symbol for the:
  - Response variable?
    - $Y$
    - What is another name for the response variable?
      - Dependent variable
    - Is $Y$ categorical?
      - No
    - Is $Y$ random?
      - Yes
  - Explanatory variable(s)?
    - $X$
    - What is another name for the explanatory variable(s):
      - First?
        - Independent variable
      - Second?
        - Predictor variable
    - Is $X$ random?
      - No
  - Error term?
    - $\epsilon$
    - Is $\epsilon$ random?
      - Yes
  - Intercept?
    - $\beta_0$
      - What does the intercept represent?
        - The expected value of $Y$ when $X=0$
  - Slope?
    - $\beta_1$
      - What does the slope represent?
        - The change in $Y$ for a one-unit change in $X$
- Consider the model formula $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$.
  - What is this model called?
    - Simple linear regression
  - What is an extension of this?
    - Multiple linear regression
    - What is the difference between simple and multiple linear regression?
      - The number of explanatory variables
    - What is the model formula for multiple linear regression with two explanatory variables?
      - $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \epsilon$

### Regression vs alternatives

#### Correlation coefficient

- Advantages of regression:
  - First?
    - Precise quantification of relationship
  - Second?
    - Able to predict
- Advantage of correlation:
  - First?
    - Unitless
  - Second?
    - Directly quantifies strength of relationship

#### $t$-test

- Advantages of regression:
  - First?
    - Can handle multiple predictors
  - Second?
    - Can handle continuous and categorical predictors
- Advantage of $t$-test?
  - First?
    - Compared to our regression model, can handle differing variances between groups

### Assumptions

- What type of regression do we consider?
  - Linear regression
- What are the restrictions:
  - First?
    - Distribution of response
    - What must it be?
      - Normal
  - Second?
    - Relationship with response variables
    - What must it be?
      - Linear
  - Third?
    - Variance
    - What must it be?
      - Must be constant
      - With respect to?
        - Predictor variables
  - Fourth?
    - Errors
    - What must they be?
      - Independent
      - Of:
        - First?
          - Each other
        - Second?
          - Predictor variables
