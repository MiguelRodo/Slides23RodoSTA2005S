#### Contrast hypothesis testing with confidence intervals

- What do confidence intervals provide?
  - A range of plausible values for the parameter.

- What do confidence intervals focus on?
  - Estimating the precision of the effect.

- What does hypothesis testing determine?
  - Whether an effect exists.
  - What is another way of saying this?
    - Detecting differences

- What is the typical concern of hypothesis testing?
  - Whether to reject a state of no effect.

#### Introduction to hypothesis testing

- What is hypothesis testing?
  - A statistical method to decide whether to reject a null hypothesis based on sample data.

- What does the null hypothesis ($H_0$) typically represent?
  - A statement of no effect or no difference.

- How is the null hypothesis typically formulated?
  - $H_0: \beta = 0$.

- What does the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) represent?
  - A statement of an effect or difference.

- How is the alternative hypothesis typically formulated?
  - $H_1: \beta \neq 0$.

- What is the objective of hypothesis testing?
  - To assess whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

#### Deriving hypothesis tests used by `summary`

- What statistical test is used for individual regression coefficients or linear combinations?
  - The t-test.

- What statistical test is used for multiple coefficients or linear combinations?
  - The F-test.

#### Hypothesis test regarding linear combinations of the regression coefficients

- What are quantities of interest often in regression analysis?
  - Linear combinations of the regression coefficients.

- Given $\boldsymbol{\beta}' = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2)'$, what hypothesis tests might we be interested in, for example:
  - First?
    - $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$.
  - Second?
    - $H_0: \beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0$.

- How can $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ be expressed as a linear combination?
  - As $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \boldsymbol{\beta} = 0$.

- How can $H_0: \beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0$ be expressed?
  - As $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \boldsymbol{\beta} = 0$.

#### T-tests for quantities of interest

- In the context of t-tests, what is the null hypothesis?
  - $H_0: \ell' \boldsymbol{\beta} = \ell' \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(0)}$.

- If the null hypothesis is true, what is the distribution of $\ell' \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$?
  - It follows a normal distribution with mean $\ell' \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(0)}$ and variance $\sigma^2 \ell' \mathbf{C} \ell$.

- How is the t-statistic calculated?
  - By $\frac{\ell' \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \ell' \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(0)}}{s \sqrt{\ell' \mathbf{C} \ell}}$.

- Under the null hypothesis, what distribution does the t-statistic follow?
  - A t-distribution with $n - k$ degrees of freedom.

- How is the p-value calculated in a t-test?
  - As $2 \times \mathrm{Pr}(T_{n - k} > |t|)$.

#### Testing linear combinations of coefficients

- What is an example question when testing linear combinations of coefficients, regarding the advertising dataset?
  - Is there a statistically significant difference between the effects of TV and Radio advertising?

- How is the null hypothesis formulated for the above formulated?
  - $H_0: \beta_{\text{TV}} - \beta_{\text{Radio}} = 0$.

- How is the alternative hypothesis formulated?
  - $H_1: \beta_{\text{TV}} - \beta_{\text{Radio}} \neq 0$.

- How is the test statistic calculated in this context?
  - By setting $\ell = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ and computing the t-statistic.

#### Testing multiple regression coefficients simultaneously

- When might we need to test multiple regression coefficients simultaneously?
  - When we want to test whether multiple coefficients are zero at the same time.

- What is an example of such a hypothesis?
  - $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$.

- What statistical test is required to test multiple coefficients simultaneously?
  - An F-test.

#### Multiple linear combinations

- How can testing multiple coefficients be viewed?
  - As testing multiple linear combinations of the coefficients.

- How can the null hypothesis $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$ be expressed in matrix form?
  - As $\mathbf{L} \boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{0}$.

- What is the dimension of $\mathbf{L}$ in this case?
  - $\mathbf{L}$ is a $2 \times 3$ matrix.

#### Deriving the F-statistic

- Under the general linear model, what is the distribution of $\mathbf{L}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$?
  - It follows a normal distribution with mean $\mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and variance $\sigma^2 \mathbf{L} \mathbf{C} \mathbf{L}^\top$.

- What is the formula for the quadratic form closely related to this?
  - $(\mathbf{L}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{\beta})^\top (\mathbf{L} \mathbf{C} \mathbf{L}^\top)^{-1} (\mathbf{L}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{\beta})$.
  - What is its distribution?
    - $\chi^2_{q}$.
  - Symbol for it?
    - $Q$.

- Why do we use $s^2$ instead of $\sigma^2$ in constructing the F-statistic?
  - Because $\sigma^2$ is unknown, and $s^2$ is its unbiased estimator.

- What is the final form of the F-statistic?
  - $\frac{Q/q}{s^2}$.
  - Written out fully?
    - $\frac{(\mathbf{L}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{\beta})^\top (\mathbf{L} \mathbf{C} \mathbf{L}^\top)^{-1} (\mathbf{L}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{\beta})/q}{s^2}$.
  - What is its distribution?
    - An F-distribution with $q$ and $n - k$ degrees of freedom.

#### Advice on interpreting hypothesis tests

- What are some key points about interpreting p-values:
  - First, regarding the threshold?
    - $p < 0.05$ is often considered statistically significant.
  - Second, regarding the evidence?
    - The evidence against the null hypothesis increases as $p$ decreases.
  - Third, regarding interpreting it probabilistically?
    - Do not interpret p-values as the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
  - Fourth, when the p-value is larger than 0.05?
    - If the p-value is larger than 0.05, consider whether the sample size was sufficient to detect an effect.

- What should be considered besides statistical significance?
  - The magnitude of the effect (effect size).

- Why is considering effect size important?
  - Because a statistically significant result may have a negligible practical impact.

- What model assumptions should be ensured before interpreting results?
  - Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.

#### Advice on reporting hypothesis tests

- What is one piece of advice on including p-values in text?
  - Include p-values directly in the text when reporting results.

- What should be avoided when denoting significance levels?
  - Using asterisks; instead, report exact p-values.

- Where else can p-values or significance levels be included?
  - In plots where appropriate.
