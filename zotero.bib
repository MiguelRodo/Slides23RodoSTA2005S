The demand for containerization options come from users who want to take advantage of the portability and reproducibility containers can provide, as well as being able to build and use applications that are only distributed in container form or are otherwise unsuited to natively run in an HPC environment. The users served by the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility are no exception. We go over the past and current containerization offerings at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, mainly focusing on the Summit supercomputer. We arrive at using a combination of Podman and Singularity to allow users to build and run containers directly on Summit, without requiring external resources or hardware for any step of the process. We look at a couple of projects running on Summit that greatly benefited from being able to use containers on Summit. And we compare benchmarks running natively and in containers on Summit at different scales, observing minimal performance difference and consistent behavior across all tests.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackground:Recent evidence suggests that the duration of protection by bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) may exceed previous estimates with potential implications for estimating clinical and cost-efficacy.Objectives:To estimate the protection and duration of protection provided by BCG vaccination against tuberculosis, explore how this protection changes with time since vaccination, and examine the reasons behind the variation in protection and the rate of waning of protection.Data sources:Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Databases, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Web of Knowledge, Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs), MEDCARIB Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched from inception to May 2009. Index to Theses, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI) Abstracts, Scopus, Article First, Academic Complete, Africa-Wide Information, Google Scholar, Global Health, British National Bibliography for Report Literature, and clinical trial registration websites were searched from inception to October 2009.Review methods:Electronic databases searches, screening of identified studies, data extraction and analysis were undertaken. Meta-analysis was used to present numerical and graphical summaries of clinical efficacy and efficacy by time since vaccination. Evidence of heterogeneity was assessed using the tau-squared statistic. Meta-regression allowed the investigation of observed heterogeneity. Factors investigated included BCG strain, latitude, stringency of pre-BCG vaccination tuberculin testing, age at vaccination, site of disease, study design and vulnerability to biases. Rate of waning of protection was estimated using the ratio of the measure of efficacy after 10 years compared with the efficacy in the first 10 years of a study.Results:Study selection A total of 21,030 references were identified, providing data on 132 studies after abstract and full-text review. Efficacy Protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults is variable, ranging from substantial protection in the UK MRC trial \{rate ratio 0.22 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.31]\}, to absence of clinically important benefit, as in the large Chingleput trial [rate ratio 1.05 (95\% CI 0.88 to 1.25)] and greater in latitudes further away from the equator. BCG vaccination efficacy was usually high, and varied little by form of disease (with higher protection against meningeal and military tuberculosis) or study design when BCG vaccination was given only to infants or to children after strict screening for tuberculin sensitivity. High levels of protection against death were observed from both trials and observational studies. The observed protective effect of BCG vaccination did not differ by the strain of BCG vaccine used in trials.Duration:Reviewed studies showed that BCG vaccination protects against pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis for up to 10 years. Most studies either did not follow up participants for long enough or had very few cases after 15 years. This should not be taken to indicate an absence of effect: five studies (one trial and four observational studies) provided evidence of measurable protection at least 15 years after vaccination. Efficacy declined with time. The rate of decline was variable, with faster decline in latitudes further from the equator and in situations where BCG vaccination was given to tuberculin-sensitive participants after stringent tuberculin testing.Limitations:The main limitation of this review relates to quality of included trials, most of which were conducted before current standards for reporting were formulated. In addition, data were lacking in some areas and the review had to rely on evidence from observational studies.Conclusions:BCG vaccination protection against tuberculosis varies between populations, to an extent that cannot be attributed to chance alone. Failure to exclude those already sensitised to mycobacteria and study latitude closer to the equator were associated with lower efficacy. These factors explained most of the observed variation. There is good evidence that BCG vaccination protection declines with time and that protection can last for up to 10 years. Data on protection beyond 15 years are limited; however, a small number of trials and observational studies suggest that BCG vaccination may protect for longer. Further studies are required to investigate the duration of protection by BCG vaccination.Funding:The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.}

  abstract = {Phagocytosis can be induced via the engagement of Fcγ receptors by antibody-opsonized material. Furthermore, the efficiency of antibody-induced effector functions has been shown to be dramatically modulated by changes in antibody glycosylation. Because infection can modulate antibody glycans, which in turn modulate antibody functions, assays capable of determining the induction of effector functions rather than neutralization or titer provide a valuable opportunity to more fully characterize the quality of the adaptive immune response. Here we describe a robust and high-throughput flow cytometric assay to define the phagocytic activity of antigen-specific antibodies from clinical samples. This assay employs a monocytic cell line that expresses numerous Fc receptors: including inhibitory and activating, and high and low affinity receptors—allowing complex phenotypes to be studied. We demonstrate the adaptability of this high-throughput, flow-based assay to measure antigen-specific antibody-mediated phagocytosis against an array of viruses, including influenza, HIV, and dengue. The phagocytosis assay format further allows for simultaneous analysis of cytokine release, as well as determination of the role of specific Fcγ-receptor subtypes, making it a highly useful system for parsing differences in the ability of clinical and vaccine induced antibody samples to recruit this critical effector function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. The identification and treatment of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health priority. Accurate diagnosis of pulmonary active TB (ATB) disease remains challenging and relies on extensive medical evaluation and detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in the patient’s sputum. Further, the response to treatment is monitored by sputum culture conversion, which takes several weeks for results. Here, we sought to identify blood-based host biomarkers associated with ATB and hypothesized that immune activation markers on Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells would be associated with Mtb load in vivo and could thus provide a gauge of Mtb infection. METHODS. Using polychromatic flow cytometry, we evaluated the expression of immune activation markers on Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells from individuals with asymptomatic latent Mtb infection (LTBI) and ATB as well as from ATB patients undergoing anti-TB treatment. RESULTS. Frequencies of Mtb-specific IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells that expressed immune activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR as well as intracellular proliferation marker Ki-67 were substantially higher in subjects with ATB compared with those with LTBI. These markers accurately classified ATB and LTBI status, with cutoff values of 18\%, 60\%, and 5\% for CD38+IFN-γ+, HLA-DR+IFN-γ+, and Ki-67+IFN-γ+, respectively, with 100\% specificity and greater than 96\% sensitivity. These markers also distinguished individuals with untreated ATB from those who had successfully completed anti-TB treatment and correlated with decreasing mycobacterial loads during treatment. CONCLUSION. We have identified host blood-based biomarkers on Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells that discriminate between ATB and LTBI and provide a set of tools for monitoring treatment response and cure.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis infection (TBI) is defined as a state of infection in which individuals host live Mycobacterium tuberculosis with or without clinical signs of active TB. It is now understood as a dynamic process covering a spectrum of responses to infection resulting from the interaction between the TB bacilli and the host immune system. The global burden of TBI is about one-quarter of the world’s population, representing a reservoir of approximately 2 billion people. On average, 5–10\% of people who are infected will develop TB disease over the course of their lives, but this risk is enhanced in a series of conditions, such as co-infection with HIV. The End-TB strategy promotes the programmatic management of TBI as a crucial endeavor to achieving global targets to end the TB epidemic. The current development of new diagnostic tests capable of discriminating between simple TBI and active TB, combined with novel short-course preventive treatments, will help achieve this goal. In this paper, we present the current situation and recent developments of management of TBI and the operational challenges.},

  abstract = {Current cardiovascular risk assessment tools use a small number of predictors. Here, we study how machine learning might: (1) enable principled selection from a large multimodal set of candidate variables and (2) improve prediction of incident coronary artery disease (CAD) events. An elastic net-based Cox model (ML4HEN-COX) trained and evaluated in 173,274 UK Biobank participants selected 51 predictors from 13,782 candidates. Beyond most traditional risk factors, ML4HEN-COX selected a polygenic score, waist circumference, socioeconomic deprivation, and several hematologic indices. A more than 30-fold gradient in 10-year risk estimates was noted across ML4HEN-COX quintiles, ranging from 0.25\% to 7.8\%. ML4HENCOX improved discrimination of incident CAD (C-statistic = 0.796) compared with the Framingham risk score, pooled cohort equations, and QRISK3 (range 0.754–0.761). This approach to variable selection and model assessment is readily generalizable to a broad range of complex datasets and disease endpoints.},

  abstract = {Mobile applications have shown promise in supporting people with mental health issues to adopt healthy lifestyles using various persuasive strategies. However, the extent to which mental health apps successfully employ various persuasive strategies remains unknown. Hence, it is important to understand the persuasive strategies integrated into mental health applications (apps) and how they are implemented to promote mental health. This paper aims to achieve three main objectives. First, we review 103 mental health apps and identify distinct persuasive strategies incorporated in them using the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model and Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs). We further classify the persuasive strategies based on the type of mental health issues the app is focused on. Second, we reveal the various ways that the persuasive strategies are implemented/operationalized in mental health apps to achieve their intended objectives. Third, we examine the relationship between apps effectiveness (measured by user ratings) and the persuasive strategies employed. To achieve this, two researchers independently downloaded and used all identified apps to identify the persuasive strategies using the PSD model and BCTs. Next, they also examine the various ways that these strategies are implemented in mental health apps. The results show that the apps employed 26 distinct persuasive strategies and a range of 1–10 strategies per app. Self-monitoring (n = 59), personalization (n = 55), and reminder (n = 49) were the most frequently employed strategies. We also found that anxiety, stress, depression, and general mental health issues were the common mental health issues targeted by the apps. Finally, we offer some design recommendations for designing mental health apps based on our findings.},

  abstract = {Background. The risk of progression to active tuberculosis is greatest in the several years following initial infection. The extent to which latent tuberculosis infection reduces the risk of progressive disease following reexposure and reinfection is not known. Indirect estimates from population models have been highly variable. Methods. We reviewed prospective cohort studies of persons exposed to individuals with infectious tuberculosis that were published prior to the widespread treatment of latent tuberculosis to estimate the incidence of tuberculosis among individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI group) and without latent tuberculosis (uninfected; UI group). We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of tuberculosis disease following infection between these 2 groups. We then adjusted incidence for expected reactivation, proportion of each group that was infected, and median time of observation following infection during the study. Results. We identified 18 publications reporting tuberculosis incidence among 23 paired cohorts of individuals with and without latent infection (total N 5 19 886). The weighted mean adjusted incidence rate of tuberculosis in the LTBI and UI groups attributable to reinfection was 13.5 per 1000 person-years (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0–26.2 per 1000 person-years) and that attributable to primary infection was 60.1 per 1000 person-years (95\% CI: 38.6–87.4 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted IRR for tuberculosis in the LTBI group compared with the UI group was 0.21 (95\% CI: .14–.30). Conclusions. Individuals with latent tuberculosis had 79\% lower risk of progressive tuberculosis after reinfection than uninfected individuals. The risk reduction estimated in this study is greater than most previous estimates made through population models.},

  abstract = {Background Data Sharing is widely recognised as crucial for accelerating scientific research and improving its quality. However, data sharing is still not a common practice. Funding agencies tend to facilitate the sharing of research data by both providing incentives and requiring data sharing as part of their policies and conditions for awarding grants. The goal of our article is to answer the following question: What challenges do international funding agencies see when it comes to their own efforts to foster and implement data sharing through their policies? Methods We conducted a series of sixteen guideline-based expert interviews with representatives of leading international funding agencies. As contact persons for open science at their respective agencies, they offered their perspectives and experiences concerning their organisations’ data sharing policies. We performed a qualitative content analysis of the interviews and categorised the challenges perceived by funding agencies. Results We identify and illustrate six challenges surrounding data sharing policies as perceived by leading funding agencies: The design of clear policies, monitoring of compliance, sanctions for non-compliance, incentives, support, and limitations for funders’ own capabilities. However, our interviews also show how funders approach potential solutions to overcome these challenges, for example by coordinating with other agencies or adjusting grant evaluation metrics to incentivise data sharing. Discussion and conclusion Our interviews point to existing flaws in funders’ data sharing policies, such as a lack of clarity, a lack of monitoring of funded researchers’ data sharing behaviour, and a lack of incentives. A number of agencies could suggest potential solutions but often struggle with the overall complexity of data sharing and the implementation of these measures. Funders cannot solve each challenge by themselves, but they can play an active role and lead joint efforts towards a culture of data sharing.},

Data from 1483 participants in the BCG vaccine group and 1309 in the placebo group were analyzed.Main Outcome MeasuresEfficacy of BCG vaccine, calculated for each 10-year interval using a Cox regression model with time-dependent variables based on tuberculosis events occurring after December 31, 1947 (end of prospective case finding).ResultsThe overall incidence of tuberculosis was 66 and 138 cases per 100~000 person-years in the BCG vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, for an estimate of vaccine efficacy of 52\% (95\% confidence interval, 27\%-69\%). Adjustments for age at vaccination, tribe, subsequent BCG vaccination, chronic medical illness, isoniazid use, and bacille Calmette-Guérin strain did not substantially affect vaccine efficacy. There was slight but not statistically significant waning of the efficacy of BCG vaccination over time, greater among men than women.ConclusionIn this trial, BCG vaccine efficacy persisted for 50 to 60 years, suggesting that a single dose of an effective BCG vaccine can have a long duration of protection.},

  abstract = {Over the past four years, the Big Data and Exascale Computing (BDEC) project organized a series of five international workshops that aimed to explore the ways in which the new forms of data-centric discovery introduced by the ongoing revolution in high-end data analysis (HDA) might be integrated with the established, simulation-centric paradigm of the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Based on those meetings, we argue that the rapid proliferation of digital data generators, the unprecedented growth in the volume and diversity of the data they generate, and the intense evolution of the methods for analyzing and using that data are radically reshaping the landscape of scientific computing. The most critical problems involve the logistics of wide-area, multistage workflows that will move back and forth across the computing continuum, between the multitude of distributed sensors, instruments and other devices at the networks edge, and the centralized resources of commercial clouds and HPC centers. We suggest that the prospects for the future integration of technological infrastructures and research ecosystems need to be considered at three different levels. First, we discuss the convergence of research applications and workflows that establish a research paradigm that combines both HPC and HDA, where ongoing progress is already motivating efforts at the other two levels. Second, we offer an account of some of the problems involved with creating a converged infrastructure for peripheral environments, that is, a shared infrastructure that can be deployed throughout the network in a scalable manner to meet the highly diverse requirements for processing, communication, and buffering/storage of massive data workflows of many different scientific domains. Third, we focus on some opportunities for software ecosystem convergence in big, logically centralized facilities that execute large-scale simulations and models and/or perform large-scale data analytics. We close by offering some conclusions and recommendations for future investment and policy review.},

This requires informed and thoughtful preparation from initial research planning to collection of data/metadata, interoperability, deposit in data repositories, and curation. Research Data Canada (RDC) is a collaborative, non-government organization that promotes access to and preservation of Canadian research data. The RDC Standards and Interoperability Committee (RDCSINC) surveyed 32 Canadian and International online data platforms for storage, data transfer, curation activities, preservation, access, and sharing features. We developed a checklist to compare criteria and features between platforms. The survey revealed a heterogeneity of features and services across platforms, non-standardized use of terms, uneven compliance with relevant standards, and a paucity of certified data repositories. Recommendations for online digital infrastructure development to meet evolving researcher and end-user needs centre around persistent identification and citation of datasets, data reliability, version control, metadata, data sharing, privacy controls, long-term preservation of data, and certification of data repositories. We identified a need in Canada for investment in an integrated, comprehensive national digital infrastructure for research data.},

  abstract = {Background: Comparing phenotypes of heterogeneous cell populations from multiple biological conditions is at the heart of scientific discovery based on flow cytometry (FC). When the biological signal is measured by the average expression of a biomarker, standard statistical methods require that variance be approximately stabilized in populations to be compared. Since the mean and variance of a cell population are often correlated in fluorescence-based FC measurements, a preprocessing step is needed to stabilize the within-population variances. Results: We present a variance-stabilization algorithm, called flowVS, that removes the mean-variance correlations from cell populations identified in each fluorescence channel. flowVS transforms each channel from all samples of a data set by the inverse hyperbolic sine (asinh) transformation. For each channel, the parameters of the transformation are optimally selected by Bartlett’s likelihood-ratio test so that the populations attain homogeneous variances. The optimum parameters are then used to transform the corresponding channels in every sample. flowVS is therefore an explicit variance-stabilization method that stabilizes within-population variances in each channel by evaluating the homoskedasticity of clusters with a likelihood-ratio test. With two publicly available datasets, we show that flowVS removes the mean-variance dependence from raw FC data and makes the within-population variance relatively homogeneous. We demonstrate that alternative transformation techniques such as flowTrans, flowScape, logicle, and FCSTrans might not stabilize variance. Besides flow cytometry, flowVS can also be applied to stabilize variance in microarray data. With a publicly available data set we demonstrate that flowVS performs as well as the VSN software, a state-of-the-art approach developed for microarrays. Conclusions: The homogeneity of variance in cell populations across FC samples is desirable when extracting features uniformly and comparing cell populations with different levels of marker expressions. The newly developed flowVS algorithm solves the variance-stabilization problem in FC and microarrays by optimally transforming data with the help of Bartlett’s likelihood-ratio test. On two publicly available FC datasets, flowVS stabilizes within-population variances more evenly than the available transformation and normalization techniques. flowVS-based variance stabilization can help in performing comparison and alignment of phenotypically identical cell populations across different samples. flowVS and the datasets used in this paper are publicly available in Bioconductor.},

They exhibit commonalities but also differences, to the in vivo blood transcriptional response during natural human Mtb disease. Here, we present a description of concordant and discordant components of the immune response in blood, quantified through transcriptional profiling in an in vitro whole blood infection model compared to whole blood from patients with tuberculosis disease. We identified concordantly and discordantly expressed gene modules and performed in silico cell deconvolution. A high degree of concordance of gene expression between both adult and paediatric in vivo–in vitro tuberculosis infection was identified. Concordance in paediatric in vivo vs in vitro comparison is largely characterised by immune suppression, while in adults the comparison is marked by concordant immune activation, particularly that of inflammation, chemokine, and interferon signalling. Discordance between in vitro and in vivo increases over time and is driven by T-cell regulation and monocyte-related gene expression, likely due to apoptotic depletion of monocytes and increasing relative fraction of longer-lived cell types, such as T and B cells. Our approach facilitates a more informed use of the whole blood in vitro model, while also accounting for its limitations.},

This poses a major problem for students and researchers in the same field who cannot leverage the previously published findings for study or further inquiry. To address this, we propose an open-source platform named RE3 that helps improve the reproducibility and readability of research projects involving R code. Our platform incorporates assessing code readability with a machine learning model trained on a code readability survey and an automatic containerization service that executes code files and warns users of reproducibility errors. This process helps ensure the reproducibility and readability of projects and therefore fast-track their verification and reuse.},

  abstract = {Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) poses a major roadblock in the global effort to eradicate tuberculosis (TB). A deep understanding of the host responses involved in establishment and maintenance of TB latency is required to propel the development of sensitive methods to detect and treat LTBI. Given that LTBI individuals are typically asymptomatic, it is challenging to differentiate latently infected from uninfected individuals. A major contributor to this problem is that no clear pattern of host response is linked with LTBI, as molecular correlates of latent infection have been hard to identify. In this study, we have analyzed the global perturbations in host response in LTBI individuals as compared to uninfected individuals and particularly the heterogeneity in such response, across LTBI cohorts. For this, we constructed individualized genome-wide host response networks informed by blood transcriptomes for 136 LTBI cases and have used a sensitive network mining algorithm to identify top-ranked host response subnetworks in each case. Our analysis indicates that despite the high heterogeneity in the gene expression profiles among LTBI samples, clear patterns of perturbation are found in the immune response pathways, leading to grouping LTBI samples into 4 different immune-subtypes. Our results suggest that different subnetworks of molecular perturbations are associated with latent tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Reproducible research---by its many names---has come to be regarded as a key concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

  abstract = {The growing popularity of machine learning (ML) applications has led to the introduction of software engineering tools such as Data Versioning Control (DVC), MLFlow and Pachyderm that enable versioning ML data, models, pipelines and model evaluation metrics. Since these versioned ML artifacts need to be synchronized not only with each other, but also with the source and test code of the software applications into which the models are integrated, prior findings on co-evolution and coupling between software artifacts might need to be revisited. Hence, in order to understand the degree of coupling between ML-related and other software artifacts, as well as the adoption of ML versioning features, this paper empirically studies the usage of DVC in 391 Github projects, 25 of which in detail. Our results show that more than half of the DVC files in a project are changed at least once every one-tenth of the project’s lifetime. Furthermore, we observe a tight coupling between DVC files and other artifacts, with 1/4 pull requests changing source code and 1/2 pull requests changing tests requiring a change to DVC files. As additional evidence of the observed complexity associated with adopting ML-related software engineering tools like DVC, an average of 78\% of the studied projects showed a non-constant trend in pipeline complexity.},

In this study, we use the CiteSpace software to examine 984 publications and their 46,609 unique references on gamification applied for behavior change. The corpus of studies was downloaded from the Scopus database and refers to studies published between 2011 and the beginning of 2022. Several methods were used to analyze these data: (1) document co-citation analysis (DCA) was performed to identify the pivotal researches and the research areas; (2) author cocitation analysis (ACA) was performed to identify the main authors; (3) and keyword analysis was performed to detect the most influential keywords and their change over time. The results of the analysis provide an overview of the influential documents, authors and keywords that have given shape to the literature of the field, and how it has evolved, showing an initial interest in motivational and persuasion techniques, and in the gamification design, and subsequently in the development of more rigorous methodologies for both design and use. As the first scientometric review of gamification applied to behavior change, this study will be of interest to junior and senior researchers, graduate students, and professors seeking to identify research trends, topics, major publications, and influential scholars.},

The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {This work proposes new inference methods for a regression coefficient of interest in a (heterogeneous) quantile regression model. We consider a high-dimensional model where the number of regressors potentially exceeds the sample size but a subset of them suffice to construct a reasonable approximation to the conditional quantile function. The proposed methods are (explicitly or implicitly) based on orthogonal score functions that protect against moderate model selection mistakes, which are often inevitable in the approximately sparse model considered in the present paper. We establish the uniform validity of the proposed confidence regions for the quantile regression coefficient. Importantly, these methods directly apply to more than one variable and a continuum of quantile indices. In addition, the performance of the proposed methods is illustrated through Monte-Carlo experiments and an empirical example, dealing with risk factors in childhood malnutrition.},

We used single-cell “mass cytometry” to examine healthy human bone marrow, measuring 34 parameters simultaneously in single cells (binding of 31 antibodies, viability, DNA content, and relative cell size). The signaling behavior of cell subsets spanning a defined hematopoietic hierarchy was monitored with 18 simultaneous markers of functional signaling states perturbed by a set of ex vivo stimuli and inhibitors. The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear mixed effects models allow investigating individual differences in drug concentration profiles (pharmacokinetics) and responses. Pharmacogenetics focuses on the genetic component of this variability. Two tests often used to detect a gene effect on a pharmacokinetic parameter are (1) the Wald test, assessing whether estimates for the gene effect are significantly different from 0 and (2) the likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without the genetic effect. Because those asymptotic tests show inflated type I error on small sample size and/or with unevenly distributed genotypes, we develop two alternatives and evaluate them by means of a simulation study. First, we assess the performance of the permutation test using the Wald and the likelihood ratio statistics. Second, for the Wald test we propose the use of the F-distribution with four different values for the denominator degrees of freedom. We also explore the influence of the estimation algorithm using both the first-order conditional estimation with interaction linearization-based algorithm and the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm. We apply these methods to the analysis of the pharmacogenetics of indinavir in HIV patients recruited in the COPHAR2-ANRS 111 trial. Results of the simulation study show that the permutation test seems appropriate but at the cost of an additional computational burden. One of the four F-distribution-based approaches provides a correct type I error estimate for the Wald test and should be further investigated.},

  abstract = {The application software was massive, immense, and a rigid not too long ago. They were kept in enormous blocks of data, lying lonesomely within chunks of silicon and steel, ensuring that they would remain there, resisting change and unable to leave their position. This presented a challenge for the company because it needed to act quickly. Therefore, it wasn't a big deal when virtual machines (VMs) became popular. After that, apps were no longer connected with these bits of devices, which made everything move quickly. But regrettably, these VMs are also extremely complicated. They disguise an entire system within a different system, yet this virtual machine is nonetheless quite complex and requires management. The manner in which software is created, delivered, and maintained has been revolutionised by containers. Docker and Kubernetes have become two of the most well-known containerization techniques on the market. In-depth analysis of the fundamental ideas, features, and architectural elements of Docker and Kubernetes containers is provided in this study's report. Along with showcasing their unique functions in the container shipping environment, it goes on to investigate the distinctions and resemblance between Docker and Kubernetes. Furthermore, the report examines actual applications and used cases that heavily rely on both Kubernetes and Docker containers in order to demonstrate upon their useful advantages. In general, this research intends to give readers a good grasp of Kubernetes and Docker containers, empowering them to choose wisely whether to embrace and use them.},

  abstract = {Making scientific analyses reproducible, well documented, and easily shareable is crucial to maximizing their impact and ensuring that others can build on them. However, accomplishing these goals is not easy, requiring careful attention to organization, workflow, and familiarity with tools that are not a regular part of every scientist's toolbox. We have developed an R package, workflowr, to help all scientists, regardless of background, overcome these challenges. Workflowr aims to instill a particular "workflow" — a sequence of steps to be repeated and integrated into research practice — that helps make projects more reproducible and accessible.This workflow integrates four key elements: (1) version control (via Git); (2) literate programming (via R Markdown); (3) automatic checks and safeguards that improve code reproducibility; and (4) sharing code and results via a browsable website. These features exploit powerful existing tools, whose mastery would take considerable study. However, the workflowr interface is simple enough that novice users can quickly enjoy its many benefits. By simply following the workflowr~"workflow", R users can create projects whose results, figures, and development history are easily accessible on a static website — thereby conveniently shareable with collaborators by sending them a URL — and accompanied by source code and reproducibility safeguards. The workflowr R package is open source and available on CRAN, with full documentation and source code available at https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr.},

Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

We achieved this goal using a carefully selected combination of 14 surface markers compatible with standard flow cytometric instruments and accessible to a particularly large research community. Optimized for use in whole blood, this panel allows polymorphonuclear cell identification, supports live cell recovery, and is well-suited for absolute cell counting applications in the original in vivo volume. Panel performance and the separation of populations are high, and virtually no cells remain undefined after gating. Besides the identification of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, plasma cells, monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, this panel also covers progenitor cells and may therefore be attractive for stem cell researchers. Envisioned applications of this panel include immune monitoring within clinical trials, initial discovery to inform subset-targeted panels, and clinical diagnostics. In summary, this panel offers a broadly applicable platform for immune cell identification, quantification and characterization in human samples, particularly whole blood.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

Bonferroni correction is the simplest method for counteracting this; however, it is a conservative method that gives greater risk of failure to reject a false null hypothesis than other methods, as it ignores potentially valuable information, such as the distribution of p-values across all comparisons (which, if the null hypothesis is correct for all comparisons, is expected to take a uniform distribution).  Of note, the Bonferroni correction controls for family-wise error rate (relating to the null hypothesis being true for all comparisons simultaneously, and alternatively that the null hypothesis is false for at least one test). Alternative approaches, such as the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, are explicitly designed to control error rate when detecting individual "discoveries", and are thus more appropriate in many scenarios, such as the detection of differentially expressed genes in bioinformatics. This method is named after Carlo Bonferroni.},

If the inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs parallels that in the tuberculin skin test, the lack of immunocompetent cells and tissue hypoxia could permit pulmonary cavitation and explain the association of HLA-DR15 with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis.},

Serum antibody titres were determined by competitive inhibition with radio-labelled murine monoclonal antibodies in 67 adults and 85 children with tuberculosis and in 79 age-matched controls. BCG vaccination (n=39) and self-healed tuberculosis (n=11) in adults gave rise to higher antibody titres to TB68, TB23 and TB72 epitopes (all p{$<$}0.003) when compared to non-vaccinated controls (n=18). TB68 titres were higher (p=0.006) in self-healed than in vaccinated adults. Adult sputum-negative patients (n=15) had higher titres to TB71 (p=0.015) and ML34 (p=0.02) epitopes compared to BCG-vaccinated healthy controls, while sputum-positive patients (n=41) had higher titres to all epitopes tested (all p{$<$}10−4). The diagnostic sensitivity, with a 95 \% specificity, was best with the combination of probes TB23, TB68, TB72 for sputum-positive (85 \%) and TB78, ML34 (53 \%) for sputum-negative patients. Antibody titres in children with tuberculosis were lower than in adult patients; diagnostic sensitivity in histologically or microbiologically proven cases (n=18) was only 44 \%, while that in mediastinal lymphadenitis (n=67) was 13.5 \%. This study suggests that the magnitude and specificity of the humoral response to tubercle bacilli varies with site and severity of infection; the implications for pathogenesis or protective immunity are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the search for HLA-linked immune response genes that control susceptibility to tuberculosis, we performed HLA typing and measured antibody titers to well-defined Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigenic determinants in 101 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis and 64 healthy controls from Surabaya, Indonesia. HLA-DR2 and DQwl were associated with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (attributable risk = 36\% and 39\%, respectively), while DQw3 was associated even more strongly with the control group (preventive fraction = 57\%). Antibody titers to the TB71 and TB72 epitopes of the 38-kDa protein, present only on tubercle bacilli, were strongly associated with DR2 (Pcorr = .001 and .024, respectively). The association of both the disease and the antibody response to the 38-kDa antigen of M. tuberculosis with Class II HLA genes HLA-DR2 indicates that Ir-gene-mediated regulation of the immune response to this antigen may be of pathogenic significance for the development of sputum smear-positive tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A serological test that could help to diagnose tuberculosis, especially smear negative disease, would contribute to patient management. METHODS: Levels of antibody to distinct antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were assessed for their value in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary tuberculosis. Serum was taken from 52 patients who were smear positive, from 27 patients who were smear negative but with evidence of active tuberculosis (sputum culture positive in 16, response to antituberculosis chemotherapy in 11), from 11 patients with old healed tuberculosis (pre-antibiotic era), and from 39 healthy subjects vaccinated with BCG. RESULTS: In smear positive tuberculosis an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using a single 38 kDa antigen gave a diagnostic sensitivity of 80\% with a 100\% specificity. In smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis, however, combination of the 19 kDa antigen, lipoarabinomannan (ML 34 epitope), and hsp 65 (TB 78 epitope) was needed to achieve a sensitivity of 64\% with a specificity of 95\%. Recurrent and extensive radiographic disease with a poor prognosis was associated with high anti-38 kDa and low anti-14 kDa antibody levels in patients with active disease. Patients with less pulmonary cavitation had high anti-19 kDa titres. Bacteriological relapse during treatment was indicated by a rise in anti-14 kDa (TB68 epitope) antibodies. Four patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection showed no anti-38 kDa antibody. CONCLUSION: Antigen or epitope specific serology may help in the diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, and monitoring of chemotherapy in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Antibody levels rise during treatment of tuberculosis. This study examined when this rise occurred, whether there was recognition of new antigen binding sites (epitopes) on the same or different antigens, and how long specific antibody persisted. Forty patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis provided serum before and during treatment. Antibody levels were measured using a monoclonal antibody competition assay to epitopes restricted to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for lipoarabinomannan. Significant increases in antibody levels were apparent after 7 days of treatment. Five samples (12.5\%) had positive titers to all epitopes at the start of treatment, and this increased to 23 (58\%) during treatment. Antibody to epitopes with the poorest sensitivity (the TB23 epitope of the 19-kDa antigen and the TB78 epitope of hsp65) showed the greatest increases after treatment. Antibody to these two epitopes was also absent in some patients with relapsed tuberculosis until after treatment. Antibody titers showed a biphasic response, with a fall at 2 to 3 months of treatment. Sera from two patients showed changes in the affinity of epitope-specific antibody during treatment, whereas the majority did not. Those infected with isoniazid-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis showed a late rise in antibody. Antibody to the TB68 epitope of the 16-kDa α-crystallin homolog was short-lived, but it recurred with bacteriological relapse during treatment. Positive antibody titers persisted for at least 3 to 18 months after treatment. Diagnostic tests for tuberculosis should be evaluated using only pretreatment sera. Delayed antigenic recognition could be due to active suppression and/or failure to engage internal antigens of M. tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Males have a bias toward developing sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, whereas other forms of the disease have an equal sex ratio. Immune responses are known to be affected by estrogen and testosterone. Biomarkers may therefore be affected by these hormones, especially between 16 and 45 years of age when the differences are most marked. Using large data sets, we examined whether the male bias was significant in terms of diagnosis or predictive ability for the development of disease in those exposed to tuberculosis. Despite the large numbers, the need to specify homogeneous population groups for analysis affected the statistical power to discount a useful biomarker. In general, males showed higher interferon-gamma responses to TB antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10, whilst females had stronger tuberculin responses in those with sputum smear- and culture-positive tuberculosis, but smaller responses in those who were screened for tuberculosis and who did not develop disease. Importantly, in contacts of sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, more males who did not develop tuberculosis had tuberculin skin tests in the range between 10 and 14 mm, suggesting that sex-specific cut-offs might be better than general cut-off values for determining who should receive preventive treatment. Immunocytochemistry of the tuberculin responses correlated with cell numbers only in females. Total and anti-lipoarabinomannan IgM antibody levels were lower in males, whereas total and anti-BCG IgE antibody levels were higher. Evaluation of biomarkers should take account of the spectrum of tuberculosis and male sex bias for sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. These findings improve our understanding of how immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious tuberculosis as well as suggesting clinical applications of the differences between the sexes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine the diagnostic value of a blood interferon-gamma release assay in suspected active tuberculosis (TB). Methods 136 subjects with suspected pulmonary TB (pTB) at a single London centre with intermediate TB incidence, were clinically graded into low ({$<$}25\%), medium, or high ({$>$}75\%) likelihood of active pTB and then tested by T-SPOT®.TB assay. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture (n~=~33), treatment response (n~=~13) or a firm alternative diagnosis (n~=~90). Results Overall, the T-SPOT.TB sensitivity was 74\% (95\% confidence intervals 60–84\%), positive predictive value (PPV) 56\% (43–68\%), negative predictive value (NPV) 83\% (71–90\%), positive likelihood ratio (PLR) 1.75 and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) 0.45. Results for high pTB likelihood subjects: PPV 100\%, NPV 25\% (7–60\%), PLR {$>$}69, NLR 0.31. Results for intermediate pTB likelihood subjects: PPV 67\% (41–85\%), NPV 88\% (65–96\%), PLR 2.39, NLR 0.26. Results for low pTB likelihood subjects: PPV 15\% (6–34\%), NPV 92\% (79–97\%), PLR 1.23, NLR 0.80. False negatives occurred in 24\% of cases of active tuberculosis (4 smear and culture-positive, 3 smear negative and culture-positive, and 4 culture negative). Conclusions The predictive values and likelihood ratios show the T-SPOT.TB test does not assist in confidently confirming or excluding active TB, regardless of the pre-test probability of disease.},

Analyzing all possible data subsets of a certain size is computationally prohibitive, so we provide a finite-sample metric to approximately compute the number (or fraction) of observations that has the greatest influence on a given result when dropped. We call our resulting metric the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation. Our approximation is automatically computable and works for common estimators (including OLS, IV, GMM, MLE, and variational Bayes). We provide explicit finite-sample error bounds on our approximation for linear and instrumental variables regressions. At minimal computational cost, our metric provides an exact finite-sample lower bound on sensitivity for any estimator, so any non-robustness our metric finds is conclusive. We demonstrate that the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation is driven by a low signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, is not reflected in standard errors, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not a product of misspecification. Several empirical applications show that even 2-parameter linear regression analyses of randomized trials can be highly sensitive. While we find some applications are robust, in others the sign of a treatment effect can be changed by dropping less than 1\% of the sample even when standard errors are small.},

Overall, its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface’s similarity to lme4.},

  abstract = {The high failure rate of therapeutics showing promise in mouse models to translate to patients is a pressing challenge in biomedical science. Though retrospective studies have examined the fidelity of mouse models to their respective human conditions, approaches for prospective translation of insights from mouse models to patients remain relatively unexplored. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach for inference of disease-associated human differentially expressed genes and pathways from mouse model experiments. We examined 36 transcriptomic case studies where comparable phenotypes were available for mouse and human inflammatory diseases and assessed multiple computational approaches for inferring human biology from mouse datasets. We found that semi-supervised training of a neural network identified significantly more true human biological associations than interpreting mouse experiments directly. Evaluating the experimental design of mouse experiments where our model was most successful revealed principles of experimental design that may improve translational performance. Our study shows that when prospectively evaluating biological associations in mouse studies, semi-supervised learning approaches, combining mouse and human data for biological inference, provide the most accurate assessment of human in vivo disease processes. Finally, we proffer a delineation of four categories of model system-to-human “Translation Problems” defined by the resolution and coverage of the datasets available for molecular insight translation and suggest that the task of translating insights from model systems to human disease contexts may be better accomplished by a combination of translation-minded experimental design and computational approaches.},

  abstract = {Anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy resistance is a major clinical challenge in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), due, in part, to insufficient understanding of disease-site, protein-level mechanisms. Although proteomics data from IBD mouse models exist, data and phenotype discrepancies contribute to confounding translation from preclinical animal models of disease to clinical cohorts. We developed an approach called translatable components regression (TransComp-R) to overcome interspecies and trans-omic discrepancies between mouse models and human subjects. TransComp-R combines mouse proteomic data with patient pretreatment transcriptomic data to identify molecular features discernable in the mouse data that are predictive of patient response to therapy. Interrogating the TransComp-R models revealed activated integrin pathway signaling in patients with anti–TNF-resistant colonic Crohn’s disease (cCD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). As a step toward validation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on biopsies from a patient with cCD and analyzed publicly available immune cell proteomics data to characterize the immune and intestinal cell types contributing to anti-TNF resistance. We found that ITGA1 was expressed in T cells and that interactions between these cells and intestinal cell types were associated with resistance to anti-TNF therapy. We experimentally showed that the α1 integrin subunit mediated the effectiveness of anti-TNF therapy in human immune cells. Thus, TransComp-R identified an integrin signaling mechanism with potential therapeutic implications for overcoming anti-TNF therapy resistance. We suggest that TransComp-R is a generalizable framework for addressing species, molecular, and phenotypic discrepancies between model systems and patients to translationally deliver relevant biological insights.}

  abstract = {In the context of large-scale human system immunology studies, controlling for technical and biological variability is crucial to ensure that experimental data support research conclusions. In this study, we report on a universal workflow to evaluate both technical and biological variation in multiparameter flow cytometry, applied to the development of a 10-color panel to identify all major cell populations and T cell subsets in cryopreserved PBMC. Replicate runs from a control donation and comparison of different gating strategies assessed the technical variability associated with each cell population and permitted the calculation of a quality control score. Applying our panel to a large collection of PBMC samples, we found that most cell populations showed low intraindividual variability over time. In contrast, certain subpopulations such as CD56 T cells and Temra CD4 T cells were associated with high interindividual variability. Age but not gender had a significant effect on the frequency of several populations, with a drastic decrease in naive T cells observed in older donors. Ethnicity also influenced a significant proportion of immune cell population frequencies, emphasizing the need to account for these covariates in immune profiling studies. We also exemplify the usefulness of our workflow by identifying a novel cell-subset signature of latent tuberculosis infection. Thus, our study provides a universal workflow to establish and evaluate any flow cytometry panel in systems immunology studies.},

There has been significant debate as to whether natural Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection confers protection against reinfection. Here we experimentally assessed the protection conferred by concurrent Mtb infection in macaques, a robust experimental model of human tuberculosis (TB), using a combination of serial imaging and Mtb challenge strains differentiated by DNA identifiers. Strikingly, ongoing Mtb infection provided complete protection against establishment of secondary infection in over half of the macaques and allowed near sterilizing bacterial control for those in which a secondary infection was established. By contrast, boosted BCG vaccination reduced granuloma inflammation but had no impact on early granuloma bacterial burden. These findings are evidence of highly effective concomitant mycobacterial immunity in the lung, which may inform TB vaccine design and development.},

  abstract = {This research aimed to understand the needs and habits of researchers in relation to code sharing and reuse; gather feedback on prototype code notebooks created by NeuroLibre; and help determine strategies that publishers could use to increase code sharing. We surveyed 188 researchers in computational biology. Respondents were asked about how often and why they look at code, which methods of accessing code they find useful and why, what aspects of code sharing are important to them, and how satisfied they are with their ability to complete these tasks. Respondents were asked to look at a prototype code notebook and give feedback on its features. Respondents were also asked how much time they spent preparing code and if they would be willing to increase this to use a code sharing tool, such as a notebook. As a reader of research articles the most common reason (70\%) for looking at code was to gain a better understanding of the article. The most commonly encountered method for code sharing–linking articles to a code repository–was also the most useful method of accessing code from the reader’s perspective. As authors, the respondents were largely satisfied with their ability to carry out tasks related to code sharing. The most important of these tasks were ensuring that the code was running in the correct environment, and sharing code with good documentation. The average researcher, according to our results, is unwilling to incur additional costs (in time, effort or expenditure) that are currently needed to use code sharing tools alongside a publication. We infer this means we need different models for funding and producing interactive or executable research outputs if they are to reach a large number of researchers. For the purpose of increasing the amount of code shared by authors,               PLOS Computational Biology               is, as a result, focusing on policy rather than tools.},

  abstract = {Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modeling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the fraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general highdimensional nonlinear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of model-X knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand`es, 2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with n ≥ p, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn’s disease in the United Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in statistical software have led to the rapid diffusion of new methods for modelling longitudinal data. Multilevel (also known as hierarchical or random effects) models for binary outcomes have generally been based on a logistic–normal specification, by analogy with earlier work for normally distributed data. The appropriate application and interpretation of these models remains somewhat unclear, especially when compared with the computationally more straightforward semiparametric or ‘marginal’ modelling (GEE) approaches. In this paper we pose two interrelated questions. First, what limits should be placed on the interpretation of the coefficients and inferences derived from random-effect models involving binary outcomes? Second, what diagnostic checks are appropriate for evaluating whether such random-effect models provide adequate fits to the data? We address these questions by means of an extended case study using data on adolescent smoking from a large cohort study. Bayesian estimation methods are used to fit a discrete-mixture alternative to the standard logistic–normal model, and posterior predictive checking is used to assess model fit. Surprising parallels in the parameter estimates from the logistic–normal and mixture models are described and used to question the interpretability of the socalled ‘subject-specific’ regression coefficients from the standard multilevel approach. Posterior predictive checks suggest a serious lack of fit of both multilevel models. The results do not provide final answers to the two questions posed, but we expect that lessons learned from the case study will provide general guidance for further investigation of these important issues.},

  abstract = {Clustering of variables is as a way to arrange variables into homogeneous clusters, i.e., groups of variables which are strongly related to each other and thus bring the same information. These approaches can then be useful for dimension reduction and variable selection. Several specific methods have been developed for the clustering of numerical variables. However concerning qualitative variables or mixtures of quantitative and qualitative variables, far fewer methods have been proposed. The R package ClustOfVar was specifically developed for this purpose. The homogeneity criterion of a cluster is defined as the sum of correlation ratios (for qualitative variables) and squared correlations (for quantitative variables) to a synthetic quantitative variable, summarizing "as good as possible" the variables in the cluster. This synthetic variable is the first principal component obtained with the PCAMIX method. Two algorithms for the clustering of variables are proposed: iterative relocation algorithm and ascendant hierarchical clustering. We also propose a bootstrap approach in order to determine suitable numbers of clusters. We illustrate the methodologies and the associated package on small datasets.},

In this paper, we give a new presentation of PCAMIX where the principal components and the squared loadings are obtained from a Singular Value Decomposition. The loadings of the quantitative variables and the principal coordinates of the categories of the qualitative variables are also obtained directly. In this context, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for varimax rotation in PCAMIX and a direct solution for the optimal angle of rotation. A simulation study shows the good computational behavior of the proposed algorithm. An application on a real data set illustrates the interest of using rotation in MCA.

  abstract = {Automated flow cytometry (FC) data analysis tools for cell population identification and characterization are increasingly being used in academic, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and clinical laboratories. The development of these computational methods is designed to overcome reproducibility and process bottleneck issues in manual gating, however, the take-up of these tools remains (anecdotally) low. Here, we performed a comprehensive literature survey of state-of-the-art computational tools typically published by research, clinical, and biomanufacturing laboratories for automated FC data analysis and identified popular tools based on literature citation counts. Dimensionality reduction methods ranked highly, such as generic t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and its initial Matlab-based implementation for cytometry data viSNE. Software with graphical user interfaces also ranked highly, including PhenoGraph, SPADE1, FlowSOM, and Citrus, with unsupervised learning methods outnumbering supervised learning methods, and algorithm type popularity spread across K-Means, hierarchical, density-based, model-based, and other classes of clustering algorithms. Additionally, to illustrate the actual use typically within clinical spaces alongside frequent citations, a survey issued by UK NEQAS Leucocyte Immunophenotyping to identify software usage trends among clinical laboratories was completed. The survey revealed 53\% of laboratories have not yet taken up automated cell population identification methods, though among those that have, Infinicyt software is the most frequently identified. Survey respondents considered data output quality to be the most important factor when using automated FC data analysis software, followed by software speed and level of technical support. This review found differences in software usage between biomedical institutions, with tools for discovery, data exploration, and visualization more popular in academia, whereas automated tools for specialized targeted analysis that apply supervised learning methods were more used in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {The advent of mass cytometry increased the number of parameters measured at the single-cell level while decreasing the extent of crosstalk between channels relative to dye-based flow cytometry. Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels.

It was discovered by André-Louis Cholesky for real matrices, and posthumously published in 1924.

  abstract = {The results of the RV144 HIV vaccine, in combination with several recent non-human primate vaccine studies continue to highlight the potentially protective role of non-neutralizing Fc functional antibodies in HIV vaccine design. For many currently licensed vaccines, assays that detect antigen-specific antibody titers or neutralization levels have been used as a correlate of protection. However, antibodies can confer protection through multiple other mechanisms beyond neutralization, or mechanisms which are not dependent on total antibody titers. Alternative strategies that allow us to further understand the precise mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against HIV and other infectious pathogens is vitally important for the development of future vaccines. Systems serology aims to comprehensively survey a diverse array of antibody features and functions, in order to simultaneously examine the mechanisms behind and distinguish the most important antibody features required for protection, thus identifying key targets for future experimental vaccine testing. This review will focus on the technical aspects required for the application of Systems serology and summarizes the recent advances provided by application of this systemic analytical approach.},

  abstract = {While antibody titers and neutralization are considered the gold standard for the selection of successful vaccines, these parameters are often inadequate predictors of protective immunity. As antibodies mediate an array of extra-neutralizing Fc functions, when neutralization fails to predict protection, investigating Fc-mediated activity may help identify immunological correlates and mechanism(s) of humoral protection. Here, we used an integrative approach termed Systems Serology to analyze relationships among humoral responses elicited in four HIV vaccine trials. Each vaccine regimen induced a unique humoral ‘‘Fc fingerprint.’’ Moreover, analysis of case:control data from the first moderately protective HIV vaccine trial, RV144, pointed to mechanistic insights into immune complex composition that may underlie protective immunity to HIV. Thus, multi-dimensional relational comparisons of vaccine humoral fingerprints offer a unique approach for the evaluation and design of novel vaccines against pathogens for which correlates of protection remain elusive.},

This tutorial introduces Code Ocean, a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform that attempts to solve these problems. It does this by adapting software engineering tools, such as Docker, for easier use by scientists and scientific audiences. In this article, we first outline arguments for the importance of computational reproducibility, as well as some reasons why this is a nontrivial problem for researchers. We then provide a step-by-step guide to getting started with containers in research using Code Ocean. (Disclaimer: the authors all worked for Code Ocean at the time of this article’s writing.)},

  abstract = {The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry is the prototypical assay for multi-parameter single cell analysis, and is essential in vaccine and biomarker research for the enumeration of antigen-specific lymphocytes that are often found in extremely low frequencies (0.1\% or less). Standard analysis of flow cytometry data relies on visual identification of cell subsets by experts, a process that is subjective and often difficult to reproduce. An alternative and more objective approach is the use of statistical models to identify cell subsets of interest in an automated fashion. Two specific challenges for automated analysis are to detect extremely low frequency event subsets without biasing the estimate by pre-processing enrichment, and the ability to align cell subsets across multiple data samples for comparative analysis. In this manuscript, we develop hierarchical modeling extensions to the Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) approach we have previously described for cell subset identification, and show that the hierarchical DPGMM (HDPGMM) naturally generates an aligned data model that captures both commonalities and variations across multiple samples. HDPGMM also increases the sensitivity to extremely low frequency events by sharing information across multiple samples analyzed simultaneously. We validate the accuracy and reproducibility of HDPGMM estimates of antigen-specific T cells on clinically relevant reference peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples with known frequencies of antigen-specific T cells. These cell samples take advantage of retrovirally TCR-transduced T cells spiked into autologous PBMC samples to give a defined number of antigen-specific T cells detectable by HLA-peptide multimer binding. We provide open source software that can take advantage of both multiple processors and GPU-acceleration to perform the numerically-demanding computations. We show that hierarchical modeling is a useful probabilistic approach that can provide a consistent labeling of cell subsets and increase the sensitivity of rare event detection in the context of quantifying antigen-specific immune responses.},

Early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations to identify subpopulation markers. More generally, such methods compare expression levels across sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. Given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. Here, we surveyed methods to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated pseudobulk data. To evaluate method performance, we developed a flexible simulation that mimics multi-sample scRNA-seq data. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from mouse cortex cells to uncover subpopulation-specific responses to lipopolysaccharide treatment, and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the               muscat               R package.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Single-cell omic protocols applied to disease, development or mechanistic studies can reveal the emergence of aberrant cell states or changes in differentiation. These perturbations can manifest as a shift in the abundance of cells associated with a biological condition. Current computational workflows for comparative analyses typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance between experimental conditions. However, clusters are not always an optimal representation of the biological manifold on which cells lie, especially in the context of continuous differentiation trajectories. To overcome these barriers to discovery, we present             Milo             , a flexible and scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighbourhoods on a k-nearest neighbour graph. Our method samples and refines neighbourhoods across the graph and leverages the flexibility of generalized linear models, making it applicable to a wide range of experimental settings. Using simulations, we show that             Milo             is both robust and sensitive, and can reveal subtle but important cell state perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters. We illustrate the power of             Milo             by identifying the perturbed differentiation during ageing of a lineage-biased thymic epithelial precursor state and by uncovering extensive perturbation to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver.             Milo             is provided as an open-source R software package with documentation and tutorials at             https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR             .},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb) is the leading cause of death from infection worldwide               1               . The only available vaccine, BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin), is given intradermally and has variable efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis, the major cause of mortality and disease transmission               1,2               . Here we show that intravenous administration of BCG profoundly alters the protective outcome of Mtb challenge in non-human primates (               Macaca mulatta               ). Compared with intradermal or aerosol delivery, intravenous immunization induced substantially more antigen-responsive CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in blood, spleen, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung lymph nodes. Moreover, intravenous immunization induced a high frequency of antigen-responsive T cells across all lung parenchymal tissues. Six months after BCG vaccination, macaques were challenged with virulent Mtb. Notably, nine out of ten macaques that received intravenous BCG vaccination were highly protected, with six macaques showing no detectable levels of infection, as determined by positron emission tomography–computed tomography imaging, mycobacterial growth, pathology and granuloma formation. The finding that intravenous BCG prevents or substantially limits Mtb infection in highly susceptible rhesus macaques has important implications for vaccine delivery and clinical development, and provides a model for defining immune correlates and mechanisms of vaccine-elicited protection against tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Antibody features vary with tuberculosis (TB) disease state. Whether clinical variables, such as age or sex, influence associations between Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antibody responses and disease state is not well explored. Here we profiled Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antibody responses in 140 TB-exposed South African individuals from the Adolescent Cohort Study. We identified distinct response features in individuals progressing to active TB from non-progressing, matched controls. A multivariate antibody score differentially associated with progression (SeroScore) identified progressors up to 2\,years before TB diagnosis, earlier than that achieved with the RISK6 transcriptional signature of progression. We validated these antibody response features in the Grand Challenges 6–74 cohort. Both the SeroScore and RISK6 correlated better with risk of TB progression in adolescents compared with adults, and in males compared with females. This suggests that age and sex are important, underappreciated modifiers of antibody responses associated with TB progression.}

  abstract = {High Ag load in chronic viral infections has been associated with impairment of Ag-specific T cell responses; however, the relationship between Ag load in chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and functional capacity of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells in humans is not clear. We compared M. tuberculosis-specific T cell-associated cytokine production and proliferative capacity in peripheral blood from adults with progressively higher mycobacterial loads—that is, persons with latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI), with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and smear-positive TB. Patients with smear-positive TB had decreased polyfunctional IFN-γ+IL-2+TNF-α+ and IL-2–producing specific CD4 T cells and increased TNF-α single-positive cells, when compared with smear-negative TB and LTBI. TB patients also had increased frequencies of M. tuberculosis-specific CD8 T cells, compared with LTBI. M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferative capacity was profoundly impaired in individuals with smear-positive TB, and correlated positively with ex vivo IFN-γ+IL-2+TNF-α+ CD4 T cells, and inversely with TNF-α single-positive CD4 T cells. During 6 mo of anti-TB treatment, specific IFN-γ+IL-2+TNF-α+ CD4 and CD8 T cells increased, whereas TNF-α and IFN-γ single-positive T cells decreased. These results suggest progressive impairment of M. tuberculosis-specific T cell responses with increasing mycobacterial load and recovery of responses during therapy. Furthermore, these data provide a link between specific cytokine-producing subsets and functional capacity of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells, and between the presence of specific CD8 T cells ex vivo and active TB disease. These data have potentially significant applications for the diagnosis of TB and for the identification of T cell correlates of TB disease progression.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, thus there is an urgent need for novel TB vaccines. Objectives: We investigated a novel TB vaccine candidate, M72/AS01, in a phase IIa trial of bacille Calmette-Guérin–vaccinated, HIV-uninfected, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)–infected and -uninfected adults in South Africa. Methods: Two doses of M72/AS01 were administered to healthy adults, with and without latent Mtb infection. Participants were monitored for 7 months after the first dose; cytokine production profiles, cell cycling, and regulatory phenotypes of vaccine-induced T cells were measured by flow cytometry. Measurements and Main Results: The vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile, and induced robust, long-lived M72-specific T-cell and antibody responses. M72-specific CD4 T cells produced multiple combinations of Th1 cytokines. Analysis of T-cell Ki67 expression showed that most vaccination-induced T cells did not express Th1 cytokines or IL-17; these cytokine-negative Ki67+ T cells included subsets of CD4 T cells with regulatory phenotypes. PD-1, a negative regulator of activated T cells, was transiently expressed on M72-specific CD4 T cells after vaccination. Specific T-cell subsets were present at significantly higher frequencies after vaccination of Mtb-infected versus -uninfected participants. Conclusions: M72/AS01 is clinically well tolerated in Mtb-infected and -uninfected adults, induces high frequencies of multifunctional T cells, and boosts distinct T-cell responses primed by natural Mtb infection. Moreover, these results provide important novel insights into how this immunity may be appropriately regulated after novel TB vaccination of Mtb-infected and -uninfected individuals.

When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve is constructed by varying the cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data. This paper presents a nonparametric approach to the analysis of areas under correlated ROC curves, by using the theory on generalized U-statistics to generate an estimated covariance matrix.},

  abstract = {Background: The European Commission is funding projects that aim to establish data-sharing platforms. These platforms are envisioned to enhance and facilitate the international sharing of cohort data. Nevertheless, broad data sharing may be restricted by the lack of adequate recognition for those who share data. Objective: The aim of this study is to describe in depth the concerns about acquiring credit for data sharing within epidemiological research. Methods: A total of 17 participants linked to European Union–funded data-sharing platforms were recruited for a semistructured interview. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Interviewees argued that data sharing within international projects could challenge authorship guidelines in multiple ways. Some respondents considered that the acquisition of credit for articles with extensive author lists could be problematic in some instances, such as for junior researchers. In addition, universities may be critical of researchers who share data more often than leading research. Some considered that the evaluation system undervalues data generators and specialists. Respondents generally looked favorably upon alternatives to the current evaluation system to potentially ameliorate these issues. Conclusions: The evaluation system might impede data sharing because it mainly focuses on first and last authorship and undervalues the contributor’s work. Further movement of crediting models toward contributorship could potentially address this issue. Appropriate crediting mechanisms that are better aligned with the way science ought to be conducted in the future need to be developed.},

  abstract = {We consider the learning dynamics of a single reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agent when it interacts with an event-driven agent-based financial market model. Trading takes place asynchronously through a matching engine in event time. The optimal execution agent is considered at different levels of initial order sizes and differently sized state spaces. The resulting impact on the agent-based model and market is considered using a calibration approach that explores changes in the empirical stylised facts and price impact curves. Convergence, volume trajectory and action trace plots are used to visualise the learning dynamics. The smaller state space agents had the number of states they visited converge much faster than the larger state space agents, and they were able to start learning to trade intuitively using the spread and volume states. We find that the moments of the model are robust to the impact of the learning agents, except for the Hurst exponent, which was lowered by the introduction of strategic order-splitting. The introduction of the learning agent preserves the shape of the price impact curves but can reduce the trade-sign auto-correlations and increase the micro-price volatility when the trading volumes increase.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that lower respiratory tract infections (excluding tuberculosis) account for ∼35\% of all deaths caused by infectious diseases. In many cases, the cause of death may be caused by multiple pathogens, e.g., the life-threatening bacterial pneumonia observed in patients infected with influenza virus. The ability to evolve more efficient immunity on each successive encounter with antigen is the hallmark of the adaptive immune response. However, in the absence of cross-reactive T and B cell epitopes, one lung infection can modify immunity and pathology to the next for extended periods of time. We now report for the first time that this phenomenon is mediated by a sustained desensitization of lung sentinel cells to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands; this is an effect that lasts for several months after resolution of influenza or respiratory syncytial virus infection and is associated with reduced chemokine production and NF-κB activation in alveolar macrophages. Although such desensitization may be beneficial in alleviating overall immunopathology, the reduced neutrophil recruitment correlates with heightened bacterial load during secondary respiratory infection. Our data therefore suggests that post-viral desensitization to TLR signals may be one possible contributor to the common secondary bacterial pneumonia associated with pandemic and seasonal influenza infection.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of mortality worldwide, due in part to a limited understanding of its clinical pathogenic spectrum of infection and disease. Historically, scientific research, diagnostic testing, and drug treatment have focused on addressing one of two disease states: latent TB infection or active TB disease. Recent research has clearly demonstrated that human TB infection, from latent infection to active disease, exists within a continuous spectrum of metabolic bacterial activity and antagonistic immunological responses. This revised understanding leads us to propose two additional clinical states: incipient and subclinical TB. The recognition of incipient and subclinical TB, which helps divide latent and active TB along the clinical disease spectrum, provides opportunities for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to prevent progression to active TB disease and transmission of TB bacilli. In this report, we review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, immunology, clinical epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of both incipient and subclinical TB, two emerging clinical states of an ancient bacterium.},

  abstract = {Approximately 100 million newborn children receive Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) annually, because vaccination is consistently protective against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB. By contrast, BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB in children and adults is highly variable, ranging from 0\% to 80\%, though it tends to be higher in individuals who have no detectable prior exposure to mycobacterial infections, as judged by the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity response (a negative tuberculin skin test, TST). The duration of protection against pulmonary TB is also variable, but lasts about 10 years on average. These observations raise the possibility that BCG revaccination, following primary vaccination in infancy, could be efficacious among TST-negative adolescents as they move into adulthood, the period of highest risk for pulmonary disease. To inform continuing debate about revaccination, this paper assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adolescents in a setting with intense transmission—Cape Town, South Africa. For a cost of revaccination in the range US\$1–10 per person, and vaccine efficacy between 10\% and 80\% with protection for 10 years, the incremental cost per year of healthy life recovered (disability-adjusted life years, DALY) in the vaccinated population lies between US\$116 and US\$9237. The intervention is about twice as cost-effective when allowing for the extra benefits of preventing transmission, with costs per DALY recovered in the range US\$52–\$4540. At 80\% efficacy, revaccination averted 17\% of cases. Under the scenarios investigated, BCG revaccination is cost-effective against international benchmarks, though not highly effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios would be more favourable if we also allow for TB cases averted by preventing transmission to HIV-positive people, for the protection of HIV-negative people who later acquire HIV infection, for the possible non-specific benefits of BCG, for the fact that some adolescents would receive BCG for the first time, and for cost sharing when BCG is integrated into an adolescent immunization programme. These findings suggest, subject to further evaluation, that BCG revaccination could be cost-effective in some settings.},

As a result, all the unprivileged functions can be used nested inside of another container, even if the container runtime prevents any elevated privileges. As of version 1.2.0 Apptainer also supports completely unprivileged encryption of Singularity Image Format (SIF) container files.

A novel geometric interpretation of the stress function and multidimensional scaling in general (Geometric MDS) has been proposed. Following this interpretation, the step size and direction forward the minimum of the stress function are found analytically for a separate point without reference to the analytical expression of the stress function, numerical evaluation of its derivatives and the linear search. It is proved theoretically that the direction coincides with the steepest descent direction, and the analytically found step size guarantees the decrease of stress in this direction. A strategy of application of the discovered option to minimize the stress function is presented and examined. It is compared with SMACOF version of MDS. The novel geometric approach will allow developing a new class of algorithms to minimize MDS stress, including global optimization and high-performance computing.},

In this paper, the stress function and multidimensional scaling, in general, have been considered from the geometric point of view. The so-called Geometric MDS has been developed. The new interpretation of the stress allows finding the proper step size, and the descent direction forwards the minimum of the stress function analytically if we consider and move a separate point of the projected space. The exceptional property of the new approach is that we do not need the analytical expression of the stress function. There is no need for numerical evaluation of its derivatives, too. Moreover, we do not need for the linear search that is used for local descent in optimization. Theoretical analysis disclosed that the step direction, determined by Geometric MDS, coincides with the steepest descent direction. The analytically found step size is such that it guarantees the decrease of the stress in this direction. Two realizations of Geometric MDS are proposed and examined. The comparison with SMACOF realization of MDS looks very promising.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an often-used method to reduce the dimensionality of multidimensional data nonlinearly and to present the data visually. MDS minimizes some stress function which variables are coordinates of points in the projected lower-dimensional space. Recently, the so-called Geometric MDS has been developed, where the stress function and multidimensional scaling, in general, are considered from the geometric point of view. Using ideas of Geometric MDS, it is possible to construct the iterative procedure of minimization of the stress where coordinates of a separate point of the projected space are moved to the new position defined analytically. In this paper, we discover and prove the main advantage of Geometric MDS theoretically: changing the position of all the points of the projected space simultaneously (independently of each other) in the directions and with steps, defined analytically by Geometric MDS strategy for a separate point, decreases the MDS stress. Moreover, the analytical updating of coordinates of projected points in each iteration has a simple geometric interpretation. New properties of Geometric MDS have been discovered. The obtained results allow us for the future development of a class of new both sequential and parallel algorithms. Ideas for global optimization of the stress are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The classic frequentist theory of hypothesis testing developed by Neyman, Pearson and Fisher has a claim to being the twentieth century's most influential piece of applied mathematics. Something new is happening in the twenty-first century: high-throughput devices, such as microarrays, routinely require simultaneous hypothesis tests for thousands of individual cases, not at all what the classical theory had in mind. In these situations empirical Bayes information begins to force itself upon frequentists and Bayesians alike. The two-groups model is a simple Bayesian construction that facilitates empirical Bayes analysis. This article concerns the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas in the two-groups setting, with particular attention focused on Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate method. Topics include the choice and meaning of the null hypothesis in large-scale testing situations, power considerations, the limitations of permutation methods, significance testing for groups of cases (such as pathways in microarray studies), correlation effects, multiple confidence intervals and Bayesian competitors to the two-groups model.},

Equidistant knots can be used, but their small and discrete number allows only limited control over smoothness and fit. We propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent B-splines. We show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral of the squared second derivative. A short overview of Bsplines, of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter. Nonparametric logistic regression, density estimation and scatterplot smoothing are used as examples. Some details of the computations are presented.},

  abstract = {Methods: We investigated gene expression of all MMPs, proteins with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in M. tuberculosis–infected human macrophages by real-time polymerase chain reaction. MMP secretion was measured by zymography and Western analysis, and expression in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was localized by immunohistochemistry. Results: MMP-1 and MMP-7 gene expression and secretion are potently upregulated by M. tuberculosis, and no increase in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase expression occurs to oppose their activity. Dexamethasone completely suppresses MMP-1 but not MMP-7 gene expression and secretion. In patients with active tuberculosis, macrophages express MMP-1 and MMP-7 adjacent to areas of tissue destruction. MMP-1 but not MMP-7 expression and secretion are relatively M. tuberculosis specific, are not upregulated by tuberculosisassociated cytokines, and are prostaglandin dependent. In contrast, the vaccine M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Gue´rin (BCG) does not stimulate MMP-1 secretion from human macrophages, although M. tuberculosis and BCG do upregulate MMP-7 equally. BCG-infected macrophages secrete reduced prostaglandin E2 concentrations compared with M. tuberculosis–infected macrophages, and prostaglandin pathway supplementation augments MMP-1 secretion from BCG-infected cells. Conclusions: M. tuberculosis specifically upregulates MMP-1 in a cellular model of human infection and in patients with tuberculosis. In contrast, vaccine BCG, which does not cause lung cavitation, does not upregulate prostaglandin E2–dependent MMP-1 secretion.},

As a result, there is a growing demand for rapid, precise, and cost-eVective measurement of such analytes in both clinical and research laboratories. Multiplex bead array assays provide quantitative measurement of large numbers of analytes using an automated 96-well plate format. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs) have long been the standard for quantitative analysis of cytokines and other biomarkers, but are not well suited for high throughput multiplex analyses. However, prior to replacement of ELISA assays with multiplex bead array assays, there is a need to know how comparable these two methods are for quantitative analyses. A number of published studies have compared these two methods and it is apparent that certain elements of these assays, such as the clones of monoclonal antibodies used for detection and reporting, are pivotal in obtaining similar results from both assays. By careful consideration of these variables, it should be possible to utilize multiplex bead array assays in lieu of ELISAs for studies requiring high throughput analysis of numerous analytes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Vaccines are one of the greatest public health achievements and have saved millions of lives. They represent a key countermeasure to limit epidemics caused by emerging infectious diseases. The Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa dramatically revealed the need for a rapid and strategic development of vaccines to effectively control outbreaks. Seven years later, in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this need has never been as urgent as it is today. Vaccine development and implementation of clinical trials have been greatly accelerated, but still lack strategic design and evaluation. Responses to vaccination can vary widely across individuals based on factors like age, microbiome, co-morbidities and sex. The latter aspect has received more and more attention in recent years and a growing body of data provide evidence that sex-specific effects may lead to different outcomes of vaccine safety and efficacy. As these differences might have a significant impact on the resulting optimal vaccine regimen, sex-based differences should already be considered and investigated in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this Review, we will highlight the clinical observations of sex-specific differences in response to vaccination, delineate sex differences in immune mechanisms, and will discuss the possible resulting implications for development of vaccine candidates against emerging infections. As multiple vaccine candidates against COVID-19 that target the same antigen are tested, vaccine development may undergo a decisive change, since we now have the opportunity to better understand mechanisms that influence vaccine-induced reactogenicity and effectiveness of different vaccines.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death worldwide due to an infectious disease, causing around 1.6 million deaths each year. This situation has become more complicated by the emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and HIV-TB co-infection, which has significantly worsened TB prognosis and treatment. Despite years of intensive research, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) remains the only licensed vaccine and has variable efficacy. It provides protection against childhood TB but is not effective in adult pulmonary TB. As a result of intense research in understanding TB vaccinology, there are many new vaccine candidates in clinical development and many more in pre-clinical trials which aim either to replace or boost BCG vaccine. This review discusses the history of BCG vaccine development and summarizes limitations of the current vaccine strategy and recent advances in improving BCG immunization along with other new vaccines in clinical trials which are promising candidates for the future tuberculosis vaccinology program.},

From among 366,625 individuals registered, 281,161 persons were vaccinated with BCG or placebo by random allocation. Two strains of BCG were used, the French and Danish, with a high dose (0.1 mg/0.1 ml) and a low dose (0.01 mg/0.1 ml) in each strain. The entire population was followed up for 15 years by means of resurveys every 30 months, and selective follow up every 10 months and continuous passive case finding. There were 560 cases (189, 191 and 180 from the high dose, low dose and placebo groups respectively) arising over 15 years, among 109,873 persons who were tuberculin negative and had a normal chest X-ray at intake. This represents a small fraction of the total incidence of 2.6 per 1000 person-years most of which came from those who were initially tuberculin positive. The incidence rates in the three "vaccination" groups were similar confirming the complete lack of protective efficacy, seen at the end of 7 1/2 years. BCG offered no overall protection in adults and a low level of overall protection (27\%; 95\% C.I. -8 to 50\%) in children. This lack of protection could not be explained by methodological flaws, or the influence of prior sensitisation by non specific sensitivity, or because most of the cases arose as a result of exogenous re-infection. The findings at 15 years show that in this population with high infection rates and high nonspecific sensitivity, BCG did not offer any protection against adult forms of bacillary pulmonary tuberculosis.},

It summarizes data that is unprecedentedly large, rapidly generated, heterogeneous, and hard to accurately interpret. This availability has also brought new challenges: How to properly annotate data to make it searchable? What are the legal and ethical hurdles when sharing data? How to store data securely, preventing loss and corruption? The life sciences are not the only disciplines that must align themselves with big data requirements to keep up with the latest developments. The large hadron collider, for instance, generates research data at a pace beyond any current biomedical research center. There are three recent major coinciding events that explain the emergence of big data in the context of research: the technological revolution for data generation, the development of tools for data analysis, and a conceptual change towards open science and data. The true potential of big data lies in pattern discovery in large datasets, as well as the formulation of new models and hypotheses. Confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson, for instance, is one of the most recent triumphs of big data analysis in physics. Digital representations of biological systems have become more comprehensive. This, in combination with advances in machine learning, creates exciting new research possibilities. In this paper, we review the state of big data in bioanalytical research and provide an overview of the guidelines for its proper usage.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry is used increasingly in clinical research for cancer, immunology and vaccines. Technological advances in cytometry instrumentation are increasing the size and dimensionality of data sets, posing a challenge for traditional data management and analysis. Automated analysis methods, despite a general consensus of their importance to the future of the field, have been slow to gain widespread adoption. Here we present OpenCyto, a new BioConductor infrastructure and data analysis framework designed to lower the barrier of entry to automated flow data analysis algorithms by addressing key areas that we believe have held back wider adoption of automated approaches. OpenCyto supports end-to-end data analysis that is robust and reproducible while generating results that are easy to interpret. We have improved the existing, widely used core BioConductor flow cytometry infrastructure by allowing analysis to scale in a memory efficient manner to the large flow data sets that arise in clinical trials, and integrating domain-specific knowledge as part of the pipeline through the hierarchical relationships among cell populations. Pipelines are defined through a text-based csv file, limiting the need to write data-specific code, and are data agnostic to simplify repetitive analysis for core facilities. We demonstrate how to analyze two large cytometry data sets: an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) data set from a published HIV vaccine trial focused on detecting rare, antigen-specific T-cell populations, where we identify a new subset of CD8 T-cells with a vaccineregimen specific response that could not be identified through manual analysis, and a CyTOF T-cell phenotyping data set where a large staining panel and many cell populations are a challenge for traditional analysis. The substantial improvements to the core BioConductor flow cytometry packages give OpenCyto the potential for wide adoption. It can rapidly leverage new developments in computational cytometry and facilitate reproducible analysis in a unified environment.},

We propose two approaches for parameter estimation: an empirical-Bayes approach using an Expectation–Maximization algorithm and a fully Bayesian one based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We compare our method against classical approaches for single-cell assays including Fisher’s exact test, a likelihood ratio test, and basic log-fold changes. Using several experimental assays measuring proteins or genes at single-cell level and simulations, we show that our method has higher sensitivity and specificity than alternative methods. Additional simulations show that our framework is also robust to model misspecification. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be extended to testing multivariate differential expression across multiple biomarker combinations using a Dirichlet-multinomial model and illustrate this approach using single-cell gene expression data and simulations.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry datasets from clinical trials generate very large datasets and are usually highly standardized, focusing on endpoints that are well defined apriori. Staining variability of individual makers is not uncommon and complicates manual gating, requiring the analyst to adapt gates for each sample, which is unwieldy for large datasets. It can lead to unreliable measurements, especially if a template-gating approach is used without further correction to the gates. In this article, a computational framework is presented for normalizing the fluorescence intensity of multiple markers in specific cell populations across samples that is suitable for high-throughput processing of large clinical trial datasets. Previous approaches to normalization have been global and applied to all cells or data with debris removed. They provided no mechanism to handle specific cell subsets. This approach integrates tightly with the gating process so that normalization is performed during gating and is local to the specific cell subsets exhibiting variability. This improves peak alignment and the performance of the algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated on two clinical trial datasets from the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). In the ITN data set we show that local normalization combined with template gating can account for sample-to-sample variability as effectively as manual gating. In the HVTN dataset, it is shown that local normalization mitigates false-positive vaccine response calls in an intracellular cytokine staining assay. In both datasets, local normalization performs better than global normalization. The normalization framework allows the use of template gates even in the presence of sample-to-sample staining variability, mitigates the subjectivity and bias of manual gating, and decreases the time necessary to analyze large datasets. © 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

Throughout, it is assumed that the regression parameters for the marginal expectations of the binary responses are of primary scientific interest. The association or time dependence between the responses is largely regarded as a nuisance characteristic of the data. The performance of the methods is compared, in terms of asymptotic bias, under misspecification of the association between the responses and the missing data mechanism or drop-out process.},

  abstract = {Abstract Modern flow cytometry systems can be coupled to plate readers for high-throughput acquisition. These systems allow hundreds of samples to be analyzed in a single day. Quality control of the data remains challenging, however, and is further complicated when a large number of parameters is measured in an experiment. Our examination of 29,228 publicly available FCS files from laboratories worldwide indicates 13.7\% have a fluorescence anomaly. In particular, fluorescence measurements for a sample over the collection time may not remain stable due to fluctuations in fluid dynamics; the impact of instabilities may differ between samples and among parameters. Therefore, we hypothesized that tracking cell populations (which represent a summary of all parameters) in centered log ratio space would provide a sensitive and consistent method of quality control. Here, we present flowClean, an algorithm to track subset frequency changes within a sample during acquisition, and flag time periods with fluorescence perturbations leading to the emergence of false populations. Aberrant time periods are reported as a new parameter and added to a revised data file, allowing users to easily review and exclude those events from further analysis. We apply this method to proof-of-concept datasets and also to a subset of data from a recent vaccine trial. The algorithm flags events that are suspicious by visual inspection, as well as those showing more subtle effects that might not be consistently flagged by investigators reviewing the data manually, and out-performs the current state-of-the-art. flowClean is available as an R package on Bioconductor, as a module on the free-to-use GenePattern web server, and as a plugin for FlowJo X. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

  abstract = {Introduction: The rapid evolution of the flow cytometry field, currently allowing the measurement of 30-50 parameters per cell, has led to a marked increase in deep multivariate information. Manual gating is insufficient to extract all this information. Therefore, multivariate analysis (MVA) methods have been developed to extract information and efficiently analyse the high-density multicolour flow cytometry (MFC) data. To aid interpretation, MFC data are often logarithmically transformed before MVA. Rationale: We studied the consequences of different transformations of flow cytometry data in datasets containing negative intensities caused by background subtractions and spreading error, as logarithmic transformation of negative data is impossible. Transformations such as logicle or hyperbolic arcsine transformations allow linearity around zero, whereas higher (positive and negative) intensities are logarithmically transformed. To define the linear range, a parameter (or cofactor) must be chosen. Results: We show how the chosen transformation parameter has great impact on the MVA results. In some cases, peak-splitting is observed, producing two distributions around 0 in an actual homogeneous population. This may be misinterpreted as the presence of multiple cell populations. Moreover, when performing arbitrary transformation before MVA analysis, biologically relevant and statistically significant information might be missed. We present a new algorithm, Optimal Transformation for flow cytometry data (OTflow), which uses various statistical methods to optimally choose the parameter of the transformation and prevent artifacts such as peak splitting. Conclusion: Arbitrary or unconsidered transformation can lead to wrong conclusions for the MVA cluster methods, dimensionality reduction methods and classification methods. We},

This paper presents the design and in-the-wild evaluation of StepMatron, a Facebook application designed to provide social and competitive context for daily pedometer readings in order to motivate physical activity in the working environment. A study was conducted in order to determine whether interactions between users via the application more successfully motivated physical activity than simply recording daily step counts in a similar application. Ten participants (1 male), all nurses working in a UK hospital, used the application across two conditions over the course of the study. In the socially-enabled condition, participants could view each other‟s step data and make comparisons and comments. In the non-social condition, participants could only view their own personal step data. A significant increase in step activity was observed in the socially enabled condition. Our findings highlight the potential of social media as a means for generating positive behaviour change. They also suggest that simple mobile devices can function as an inexpensive, accessible and powerful trigger towards this behaviour change without necessitating the use of overly complex and expensive mobile applications or devices.},

A study was conducted in order to determine whether interactions between users via the application more successfully motivated physical activity than simply recording daily step counts in a similar application. Ten participants (1 male), all nurses working in a UK hospital, used the application across two conditions over the course of the study. In the socially-enabled condition, participants could view each other's step data and make comparisons and comments. In the non-social condition, participants could only view their own personal step data. A significant increase in step activity was observed in the socially enabled condition. Our findings highlight the potential of social media as a means for generating positive behaviour change. They also suggest that simple mobile devices can function as an inexpensive, accessible and powerful trigger towards this behaviour change without necessitating the use of overly complex and expensive mobile applications or devices.},

Discussions and sketches from a workshop with Facebook users were used to develop a final design implemented using the Facebook API. Wattson energy monitors and the Wattsup app were deployed and trialled in eight homes over an eighteen day period in two conditions. In the first condition participants could only access their personal energy data, whilst in the second they could access each others' data to make comparisons. A significant reduction in energy was observed in the socially enabled condition. Comments on discussion boards and semi-structured interviews with the participants indicated that the element of competition helped motivate energy savings. The paper argues that socially-mediated banter and competition made for a more enjoyable user experience.},

Applications of MDS are found in a wide range of areas, including visualization, pattern analysis, data preprocessing, scale development, cybernetics, and localization. The overall rationale behind the paper is to help share innovations across disciplines. We survey and synthesize MDS methods from the academic areas of psychometrics, statistics, and computing. We define classical MDS and distance-based MDS. We then introduce basic MDS formulations and functions. We survey MDS techniques designed for nonlinear data and describe distance-based MDS in terms of minimizing the energy function in a spring system. We describe completely nonmetric MDS techniques for ordinal input data and describe how MDS solutions can be compared using ordinal neighborhood information. We describe optimization methods for fitting MDS models, covering both continuous optimization techniques and combinatorial techniques. We give several illustrative applications of MDS from the areas of cybernetics, air traffic control, molecular chemistry, robotics, and network localization. We link this work to the techniques described in the previous sections of the paper. We list a wide range of currently available MDS software and discuss possible future work in the area.},

Study Design and Setting We analyzed all articles from 333 open-access journals published during January 2019 by BioMed Central. We categorized types of the DAS. We surveyed corresponding authors who wrote in the DAS that they would share the data. Consent to participate in the study was sought for all included manuscripts. After accessing raw data sets, we checked whether data were available in a way that enabled reanalysis. Results Of 3556 analyzed articles, 3416 contained the DAS. The most frequent DAS category (42\%) indicated that the data sets are available on reasonable request. Among 1792 manuscripts in which the DAS indicated that authors are willing to share their data, 1669 (93\%) authors either did not respond or declined to share their data with us. Among 254 (14\%) of 1792 authors who responded to our query for data sharing, only 123 (6.8\%) provided the requested data. Conclusion Even when authors indicate in their manuscript that they will share data upon request, the compliance rate is the same as for authors who do not provide the DAS, suggesting that the DAS may not be sufficient to ensure data sharing.},

  abstract = {Large HPC centers spend considerable time supporting software for thousands of users, but the complexity of HPC software is quickly outpacing the capabilities of existing software management tools. Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, MPI, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size. We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to HPC software chaos.},

  abstract = {Behavioural design is an approach that can be used not only to understand the way people think and make decisions about their actions but also to modulate them. Current behavioural design frameworks deal with different stages of behavioural design effectively; however, designers struggle to find an integrated framework to address a socio-behavioural problem. This research uses a case study to demonstrate the application of an integrated framework for addressing the social problem related to parking behaviour in a residential area. The shortage of parking space has led to irrational parking behaviour amongst vehicle owners, which influences the social harmony of the society since it is a crucial factor in instigating aggressive behaviour and anxiety amongst vehicle owners. To solve this behavioural problem, the integrated framework uses methods from domains like nudge from behavioural economics, theory of goals and COM-B from psychology, and behavioural analysis from applied behavioural science. Behaviour definitions were employed to determine the sub-domains of current and target behaviour. Interviews with residents were conducted using the theoretical domains framework (TDF) model to assess their perspective of the problem, problem behaviour, and willingness to attain the target behaviour. The identified behaviours were further classified into meta-categories to find the category most responsible for the situation. Additionally, Fogg behaviour grid and COM-B (capability, opportunity, and motivation) model were applied to identify intervention options, which were then weighted using APEASE criteria to narrow down the suitable interventions. The behaviour change technique was applied to the selected intervention to determine the guidelines and design the artefact for achieving the target behaviour. This paper demonstrates the application of the integrated framework to improve parking behaviour in residential buildings in vertically growing cities.},

  abstract = {Background Non-protein antigen classes can be presented to T cells by near-monomorphic antigen-presenting molecules such as CD1, MR1, and butyrophilin 3A1. Such T cells, referred to as donor unrestricted T (DURT) cells, typically express stereotypic T cell receptors. The near-unrestricted nature of DURT cell antigen recognition is of particular interest for vaccine development, and we sought to define the roles of DURT cells, including MR1-restricted MAIT cells, CD1b-restricted glucose monomycolate (GMM)-specific T cells, CD1d-restricted NKT cells, and γδ T cells, in vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Methods We compared and characterized DURT cells following primary bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in a cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated infants, as well as before and after BCG-revaccination in adults. Findings BCG (re)vaccination did not modulate peripheral blood frequencies, T cell activation or memory profiles of MAIT cells, CD1b-restricted GMM-specific and germline-encoded mycolyl-reactive (GEM) cells or CD1d-restricted NKT cells. By contrast, primary BCG vaccination was associated with increased frequencies of γδ T cells as well as a novel subset of CD26+CD161+TRAV1-2− IFN-γ-expressing CD4+ T cells in infants. Interpretation Our findings, that most DURT cell populations were not modulated by BCG, do not preclude a role of BCG in modulating other qualitative aspects of DURT cells. More studies are required to understand the full potential of DURT cells in new TB vaccine strategies. Funding Aeras, the National Institutes of Health, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} Innovations in single cell technologies have lead to a flurry of datasets and computational tools to process and interpret them, including analyses of cell composition changes and transition in cell states. The diffcyt workflow for differential discovery in cytometry data consist of several steps, including preprocessing, cell population identification and differential testing for an association with a binary or continuous covariate. However, the commonly measured quantity of survival time in clinical studies often results in a censored covariate where classical differential testing is inapplicable. Results:\enspace{} To overcome this limitation, multiple methods to directly include censored covariates in differential abundance analysis were examined with the use of simulation studies and a case study. Results show that multiple imputation based methods offer on-par performance with the Cox proportional hazards model in terms of sensitivity and error control, while offering flexibility to account for covariates. The tested methods are implemented in the R package censcyt as an extension of diffcyt and are available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/censcyt. Conclusion:\enspace{} Methods for the direct inclusion of a censored variable as a predictor in GLMMs are a valid alternative to classical survival analysis methods, such as the Cox proportional hazard model, while allowing for more flexibility in the differential analysis.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis lung infection results in a complex multicellular structure: the granuloma. In some granulomas, immune activity promotes bacterial clearance, but in others, bacteria persist and grow. We identified correlates of bacterial control in cynomolgus macaque lung granulomas by co-registering longitudinal positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging, single-cell RNA sequencing, and measures of bacterial clearance. Bacterial persistence occurred in granulomas enriched for mast, endothelial, fibroblast, and plasma cells, signaling amongst themselves via type 2 immunity and wound-healing pathways. Granulomas that drove bacterial control were characterized by cellular ecosystems enriched for type 1-type 17, stem-like, and cytotoxic T~cells engaged in pro-inflammatory signaling networks involving diverse cell populations. Granulomas that arose later in infection displayed functional characteristics of restrictive granulomas and were more capable of killing Mtb. Our results define the complex multicellular ecosystems underlying (lack of) granuloma resolution and highlight host immune targets that can be leveraged to develop new vaccine and therapeutic strategies for TB.},

Results Two hundred and fifteen young people living with HIV (YPLWH) and 320 young people living without HIV were included. Young people reported an unmet need for SRH services during COVID-19, and 28\% of YPLWH reported missing an HIV care appointment during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Conclusions Expanding access to SRH services for young people during disruptive events is critical to reduce disparities in HIV and other SRH outcomes.},

Confronted with these goals, we examine what it means for research material to be transparent, available, and reproducible. As early-career researchers, we advocate for the focus to be placed on reusable and extensible research, which is naturally achieved when research material is reproducible, transparent, and open. When we understand the inner workings of a study, have access to its inputs and outputs, and are able to achieve the same results ourselves, we can more easily reuse, extend, and generalize prior efforts. To achieve the outlined reproducibility goals, one needs actionable steps that facilitate implementation and help mark progress in practice. We discuss concrete guidelines and checklists as tools for actionable reproducibility. We emphasize how a set of hierarchical recommendations that give an order of importance to the various aspects of reproducibility, transparency, and openness would help researchers facing limited resources prioritize accordingly. Finally, we discuss how training, new roles focusing on reproducibility, and supportive work environments would be beneficial.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry (FCM) is the standard multi-parameter assay for measuring single cell phenotype and functionality. It is commonly used for quantifying the relative frequencies of cell subsets in blood and disaggregated tissues. A typical analysis of FCM data involves cell classification---that is, the identification of cell subgroups in the sample---and comparisons of the cell subgroups across samples or conditions. While modern experiments often necessitate the collection and processing of samples in multiple batches, analysis of FCM data across batches is challenging because differences across samples may occur due to either true biological variation or technical reasons such as antibody lot effects or instrument optics across batches. Thus a critical step in comparative analyses of multi-sample FCM data---yet missing in existing automated methods for analyzing such data---is cross-sample calibration, whose goal is to align corresponding cell subsets across multiple samples in the presence of technical variations, so that biological variations can be meaningfully compared. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical modeling approach for accomplishing both calibration and cell classification simultaneously in a unified probabilistic manner. Three important features of our method make it particularly effective for analyzing multi-sample FCM data: a nonparametric mixture avoids prespecifying the number of cell clusters; a hierarchical skew normal kernel that allows flexibility in the shapes of the cell subsets and cross-sample variation in their locations; and finally the "coarsening" strategy makes inference robust to departures from the model such as heavy-tailness not captured by the skew normal kernels. We demonstrate the merits of our approach in simulated examples and carry out a case study in the analysis of two multi-sample FCM data sets.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Minimizing variability in collection and processing of human blood samples for research remains a challenge. Delaying plasma or serum isolation after phlebotomy (processing delay) can cause perturbations of numerous analytes. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how processing delay affects major endpoints used in human immunology research is necessary. Therefore, we studied how processing delay affects commonly measured cytokines and immune cell populations. We hypothesized that short-term time delays inherent to human research in serum and plasma processing impact commonly studied immunological analytes. Blood from healthy donors was subjected to processing delays commonly encountered in sample collection, and then assayed by 62-plex Luminex panel, 40-parameter mass cytometry panel, and 540,000 transcript expression microarray. Variance for immunological analytes was estimated using each individual’s baseline as a control. In general, short-term processing delay led to small changes in plasma and serum cytokines (range\,−\,10.8 to 43.5\%), markers and frequencies of peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotypes (range 0.19 to 3.54 fold), and whole blood gene expression (stable for\,{$>$}\,20~K genes)—with several exceptions described herein. Importantly, we built an open-access web application allowing investigators to estimate the degree of variance expected from processing delay for measurements of interest based on the data reported here.},

Inherent to the method is the expression of the data in each row or each column relative to their respective totals, and it is these sets of relative values (called profiles) that are visualized. This "relativization" of the data makes perfect sense when the margins of the table represent samples from subpopulations of inherently different sizes. But in some ecological applications sampling is performed on equal areas or equal volumes so that the absolute levels of the observed occurrences may be of relevance, in which case relativization may not be required. In this paper, I define the correspondence analysis of the raw "unrelativized" data and discuss its properties, comparing this new method to regular correspondence analysis and to a related variant of nonsymmetric correspondence analysis.},

  abstract = {Compositional data are nonnegative data carrying relative, rather than absolute, information—these are often data with a constant-sum constraint on the sample values, for example, proportions or percentages summing to 1\% or 100\%, respectively. Ratios between components of a composition are important since they are unaffected by the particular set of components chosen. Logarithms of ratios (logratios) are the fundamental transformation in the ratio approach to compositional data analysis—all data thus need to be strictly positive, so that zero values present a major problem. Components that group together based on domain knowledge can be amalgamated (i.e., summed) to create new components, and this can alleviate the problem of data zeros. Once compositional data are transformed to logratios, regular univariate and multivariate statistical analysis can be performed, such as dimension reduction and clustering, as well as modeling. Alternative methodologies that come close to the ideals of the logratio approach are also considered, especially those that avoid the problem of data zeros, which is particularly acute in large bioinformatic data sets.},

  abstract = {Selective clustering annotated using modes of projections (SCAMP) is a new clustering algorithm for data in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\textasciicircum p\$. SCAMP is motivated from the point of view of non-parametric mixture modeling. Rather than maximizing a classification likelihood to determine cluster assignments, SCAMP casts clustering as a search and selection problem. One consequence of this problem formulation is that the number of clusters is \$\textbackslash textbf\{not\}\$ a SCAMP tuning parameter. The search phase of SCAMP consists of finding sub-collections of the data matrix, called candidate clusters, that obey shape constraints along each coordinate projection. An extension of the dip test of Hartigan and Hartigan (1985) is developed to assist the search. Selection occurs by scoring each candidate cluster with a preference function that quantifies prior belief about the mixture composition. Clustering proceeds by selecting candidates to maximize their total preference score. SCAMP concludes by annotating each selected cluster with labels that describe how cluster-level statistics compare to certain dataset-level quantities. SCAMP can be run multiple times on a single data matrix. Comparison of annotations obtained across iterations provides a measure of clustering uncertainty. Simulation studies and applications to real data are considered. A C++ implementation with R interface is \$\textbackslash href\{https://github.com/RGLab/scamp\}\{available\textbackslash{} online\}\$.},

This has produced a wealth of datasets ripe for exploration but whose biological and technical heterogeneity make them difficult to analyze with current tools. We introduce a new interpretable machine learning method for single-cell mass and flow cytometry studies, FAUST, that robustly performs unbiased cell population discovery and annotation. FAUST processes data on a per-sample basis and returns biologically interpretable cell phenotypes that can be compared across studies, making it well-suited for the analysis and integration of complex datasets. We demonstrate how FAUST can be used for candidate biomarker discovery and validation by applying it to a flow cytometry dataset from a Merkel cell carcinoma anti-PD-1 trial and discover new CD4+ and CD8+ effector-memory T cell correlates of outcome co-expressing PD-1, HLA-DR, and CD28. We then use FAUST to validate these correlates in an independent CyTOF dataset from a published metastatic melanoma trial. Importantly, existing state-of-the-art computational discovery approaches as well as prior manual analysis did not detect these or any other statistically significant T cell sub-populations associated with anti-PD-1 treatment in either data set. We further validate our methodology by using FAUST to replicate the discovery of a previously reported myeloid correlate in a different published melanoma trial, and validate the correlate by identifying it             de novo             in two additional independent trials.

Special attention is given to the need for randomization to justify causal inferences from conventional statistics, and the need for random sampling to justify descriptive inferences. In most epidemiologic studies, randomization and random sampling play little or no role in the assembly of study cohorts. I therefore conclude that probabilistic interpretations of conventional statistics are rarely justified, and that such interpretations may encourage misinter pretation of nonrandomized studies. Possible remedies for this problem include deemphasizing inferential statistics in favor of data descriptors, and adopting statistical techniques based on more realistic probability models than those in common use.

To obtain the visualization, the Stress function should be minimized over the coordinates of the points and the over the transformation.

Fifty-seven per cent of patients were of white and 35\% were of Indian subcontinent (Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi) ethnic origin, the latter group contributing over half the cases of non-respiratory disease. The estimated overall annual notification rate per 100 000 population for 1978--9 was 16.4 for England and 13.5 for Wales. The rates differed considerably between the different ethnic groups in England, the highest rates occurring in the Indian and in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups and the lowest in the white group; the differences in the non-respiratory rates were the more striking. Nearly a quarter of patients with respiratory disease had large pulmonary lesions, the proportion being higher for the white group than for the Indian subcontinent group. Over half the patients had positive cultures for tubercle bacilli and over a third had positive smears; both proportions were higher for the white group. This survey has identified many of the problems which tuberculosis presents in England and Wales today. These include the substantial number of patients with sputum-positive disease, the considerable variation in the rates in the different ethnic groups, and the not uncommon occurrence of childhood tuberculosis.},

In the four and a quarter years between the surveys the number of patients notified had declined by 26\%, the decline being 28\% among those of white and 23\% among those of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin. The white patients were on average older than the patients of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin, and a higher proportion of them had respiratory disease (82\% compared with 66\%). The pulmonary lesions were on average larger and more often bacteriologically positive in the white patients. There were considerable differences between the ethnic groups in the estimated yearly rates of notifications per 100 000 population in England in 1983. The highest rates occurred in the Indian (178) and the Pakistani and Bangladeshi (169) populations and were roughly 25 times the rate in the white population (6 X 9). In the Indian subcontinent ethnic groups the highest rates occurred among those who had arrived in the United Kingdom within the previous five years.},

Recent developments of various aspects of this topic are discussed, including estimation and inference, model selection, diagnostics, missing data, and power and sample size. We focus on describing the mixed model as it is used for modeling normal outcome data linearly, but we also discuss its use in other situations, such as with discrete outcome data. We point out various software packages with the capability of fitting mixed models, and most importantly, we highlight many important articles and books for those who wish to pursue this topic further.},

  abstract = {Objectives To synthesise research investigating data and code sharing in medicine and health to establish an accurate representation of the prevalence of sharing, how this frequency has changed over time, and what factors influence availability. Design Systematic review with meta-analysis of individual participant data. Data sources Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and the preprint servers medRxiv, bioRxiv, and MetaArXiv were searched from inception to 1 July 2021. Forward citation searches were also performed on 30 August 2022. Review methods Meta-research studies that investigated data or code sharing across a sample of scientific articles presenting original medical and health research were identified. Two authors screened records, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted summary data from study reports when individual participant data could not be retrieved. Key outcomes of interest were the prevalence of statements that declared that data or code were publicly or privately available (declared availability) and the success rates of retrieving these products (actual availability). The associations between data and code availability and several factors (eg, journal policy, type of data, trial design, and human participants) were also examined. A two stage approach to meta-analysis of individual participant data was performed, with proportions and risk ratios pooled with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random effects meta-analysis. Results The review included 105 meta-research studies examining 2 121 580 articles across 31 specialties. Eligible studies examined a median of 195 primary articles (interquartile range 113-475), with a median publication year of 2015 (interquartile range 2012-2018). Only eight studies (8\%) were classified as having a low risk of bias. Meta-analyses showed a prevalence of declared and actual public data availability of 8\% (95\% confidence interval 5\% to 11\%) and 2\% (1\% to 3\%), respectively, between 2016 and 2021. For public code sharing, both the prevalence of declared and actual availability were estimated to be {$<$}0.5\% since 2016. Meta-regressions indicated that only declared public data sharing prevalence estimates have increased over time. Compliance with mandatory data sharing policies ranged from 0\% to 100\% across journals and varied by type of data. In contrast, success in privately obtaining data and code from authors historically ranged between 0\% and 37\% and 0\% and 23\%, respectively. Conclusions The review found that public code sharing was persistently low across medical research. Declarations of data sharing were also low, increasing over time, but did not always correspond to actual sharing of data. The effectiveness of mandatory data sharing policies varied substantially by journal and type of data, a finding that might be informative for policy makers when designing policies and allocating resources to audit compliance.

These stimulation steps were specifically adapted to be practical and reliable in a rural, developing country field setting. Later, in a more resourceful setting, interferon-gamma producing CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are detected by flow cytometry. The assay proved sensitive and specific for detecting mycobacteria-specific immunity 10 weeks after Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination of newborns from a rural field site.},

  abstract = {We introduce the notion of performative power, which measures the ability of a firm operating an algorithmic system, such as a digital content recommendation platform, to cause change in a population of participants. We relate performative power to the economic study of competition in digital economies. Traditional economic concepts struggle with identifying anti-competitive patterns in digital platforms not least due to the complexity of market definition. In contrast, performative power is a causal notion that is identifiable with minimal knowledge of the market, its internals, participants, products, or prices. We study the role of performative power in prediction and show that low performative power implies that a firm can do no better than to optimize their objective on current data. In contrast, firms of high performative power stand to benefit from steering the population towards more profitable behavior. We confirm in a simple theoretical model that monopolies maximize performative power. A firm’s ability to personalize increases performative power, while competition and outside options decrease performative power. On the empirical side, we propose an observational causal design to identify performative power from discontinuities in how digital platforms display content. This allows to repurpose causal effects from various studies about digital platforms as lower bounds on performative power. Finally, we speculate about the role that performative power might play in competition policy and antitrust enforcement in digital marketplaces.},

  abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

To address the problem of analyzing such data, we describe a statistical method, which we have called 'gene shaving'. The method identifies subsets of genes with coherent expression patterns and large variation across conditions. Gene shaving differs from hierarchical clustering and other widely used methods for analyzing gene expression studies in that genes may belong to more than one cluster, and the clustering may be supervised by an outcome measure. The technique can be 'unsupervised', that is, the genes and samples are treated as unlabeled, or partially or fully supervised by using known properties of the genes or samples to assist in finding meaningful groupings.},

  abstract = {In this article an investigation is made of the maximum familywise error rate (MFWER) of Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test for testing the equality of k population means in a one-way layout. An exact expression for the MFWER is derived (see Theorem 1) for all balanced models and for an unbalanced model with k = 3 populations (Type I models). A close upper bound for the MFWER is derived for all unbalanced models with four or more populations (Type II models). These expressions are used to illustrate that the MFWER may greatly exceed the nominal size α of the LSD test. In addition, a simple modification of the LSD test is proposed to control the MFWER. This modified procedure has MFWER equal to the nominal level α for Type I models and no greater than α for Type II models (Theorem 2) and is, therefore, recommended as an improvement over the LSD test. The key to the analysis is two theorems concerning the ranges of independent normal random variables, which are contained in the Appendix. The first of these theorems (Theorem A.1) is concerned with the conservative nature of unbalanced models as compared with balanced models and was published in Hayter (1984), although in a different context. The second theorem (Theorem A.2) presents a new chain of inequalities concerning the ranges of independent normal random variables partitioned into groups of differing sizes. It is believed that this new latter theorem may be of independent interest.},

However, the translation of computational results into a clinical use-case scenario remains challenging. A rate-limiting step is the rigorous selection of reliable biomarker candidates among a host of biological features included in multivariate models. We propose Stabl, a machine learning framework that unifies the biomarker discovery process with multivariate predictive modeling of clinical outcomes by selecting a sparse and reliable set of biomarkers. Evaluation of Stabl on synthetic datasets and four independent clinical studies demonstrates improved biomarker sparsity and reliability compared to commonly used SRMs at similar predictive performance. Stabl readily extends to double- and triple-omics integration tasks and identifies a sparser and more reliable set of biomarkers than those selected by state-of-the-art early- and late-fusion SRMs, thereby facilitating the biological interpretation and clinical translation of complex multi-omic predictive models. The complete package for Stabl is available online at https://github.com/gregbellan/Stabl.},

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10–30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry is a high-throughput technology used to quantify multiple surface and intracellular markers at the level of a single cell. This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew \$t\$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew \$t\$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data. We have made the method available for the community in the R package NPflow.},

  abstract = {Current nucleic acid amplification methods to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis are complex, labor-intensive, and technically challenging. We developed and performed the first analysis of the Cepheid Gene Xpert System's MTB/RIF assay, an integrated hands-free sputum-processing and real-time PCR system with rapid on-demand, near-patient technology, to simultaneously detect M. tuberculosis and rifampin resistance. Analytic tests of M. tuberculosis DNA demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.5 genomes per reaction. Studies using sputum spiked with known numbers of M. tuberculosis CFU predicted a clinical LOD of 131 CFU/ml. Killing studies showed that the assay's buffer decreased M. tuberculosis viability by at least 8 logs, substantially reducing biohazards. Tests of 23 different commonly occurring rifampin resistance mutations demonstrated that all 23 (100\%) would be identified as rifampin resistant. An analysis of 20 nontuberculosis mycobacteria species confirmed high assay specificity. A small clinical validation study of 107 clinical sputum samples from suspected tuberculosis cases in Vietnam detected 29/29 (100\%) smear-positive culture-positive cases and 33/39 (84.6\%) or 38/53 (71.7\%) smear-negative culture-positive cases, as determined by growth on solid medium or on both solid and liquid media, respectively. M. tuberculosis was not detected in 25/25 (100\%) of the culture-negative samples. A study of 64 smear-positive culture-positive sputa from retreatment tuberculosis cases in Uganda detected 63/64 (98.4\%) culture-positive cases and 9/9 (100\%) cases of rifampin resistance. Rifampin resistance was excluded in 54/55 (98.2\%) susceptible cases. Specificity rose to 100\% after correcting for a conventional susceptibility test error. In conclusion, this highly sensitive and simple-to-use system can detect M. tuberculosis directly from sputum in less than 2 h.},

  abstract = {The model generally considered in analysis of covariance has all levels of classification factors and interactions fixed, and also covariate regression coefficients fixed. Mixed models are more appropriate in most applications. A summary of estimation and hypothesis testing for analysis of covariance in the mixed model, including the case of random regression coefficients, is presented. Higher-level covariate regressions (i.e., regressions in which, for all levels of a factor or interaction, all observations on the same level have a common covariate value) are discussed. Nonestimability problems that result from defining such covariates at the levels of fixed effects are illustrated. The case of nonhomogeneous covariate regressions in the mixed model is considered in the context of interpreting predicted future differences among levels of a given factor or interaction. Nonhomogeneous regressions complicate interpretations only when they are associated with the contrast(s) of interest among fixed effects in the model. The question of whether the regressions are homogeneous is itself often of substantive interest. Different random regression coefficients associated with the levels of a random effect are also examined.},

  abstract = {Stability in cluster analysis is strongly dependent on the data set, especially on how well separated and how homogeneous the clusters are. In the same clustering, some clusters may be very stable and others may be extremely unstable. The Jaccard coefficient, a similarity measure between sets, is used as a cluster-wise measure of cluster stability, which is assessed by the bootstrap distribution of the Jaccard coefficient for every single cluster of a clustering compared to the most similar cluster in the bootstrapped data sets. This can be applied to very general cluster analysis methods. Some alternative resampling methods are investigated as well, namely subsetting, jittering the data points and replacing some data points by artificial noise points. The different methods are compared by means of a simulation study. A data example illustrates the use of the cluster-wise stability assessment to distinguish between meaningful stable and spurious clusters, but it is also shown that clusters are sometimes only stable because of the inflexibility of certain clustering methods.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the effects of six known allelic variants in the CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 genes on the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer agent paclitaxel (Taxol). Experimental Design: A cohort of 97 Caucasian patients with cancer (median age, 57 years) received paclitaxel as an i.v. infusion (dose range, 80-225 mg/m2). Genomic DNA was analyzed using PCR RFLP or using Pyrosequencing. Pharmacokinetic variables for unbound paclitaxel were estimated using nonlinear mixed effect modeling. The effects of genotypes on typical value of clearance were evaluated with the likelihood ratio test within NONMEM. In addition, relations between genotype and individual pharmacokinetic variable estimates were evaluated with oneway ANOVA. Results: The allele frequencies for the CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4, CYP3A4*3, CYP3A5*3C, and ABCB1 3435C{$>$}T variants were 0.7\%, 9.2\%, 2.1\%, 0.5\%, 93.2\%, and 47.1\%, respectively, and all were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.The population typical value of clearance of unbound paclitaxel was 301L/h (individual clearance range, 83.7-1055 L/h). The CYP2C8 or CYP3A4/5 genotypes were not statistically significantly associated with unbound clearance of paclitaxel. Likewise, no statistically significant association was observed between the ABCB1 3435C{$>$}T variant and any of the studied pharmacokinetic variables. Conclusions: This study indicates that the presently evaluated variant alleles in the CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 genes do not explain the substantial interindividual variability in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics.},

(3) To change statistical practice---by comparing these methods to common t tests and intervals, we see how inaccurate the latter are; we confirm this with asymptotics. n {$>$}= 30 isn't enough---think n {$>$}= 5000. Resampling provides diagnostics, and more accurate alternatives. Sadly, the common bootstrap percentile interval badly under-covers in small samples; there are better alternatives.

  abstract = {L-moments are expectations of certain linear combinations of order statistics. They can be defined for any random variable whose mean exists and form the basis of a general theory which covers the summarization and description of theoretical probability distributions, the summarization and description of observed data samples, estimation of parameters and quantiles of probability distributions, and hypothesis tests for probability distributions. The theory involves such established procedures as the use of order statistics and Gini's mean difference statistic, and gives rise to some promising innovations such as the measures of skewness and kurtosis described in Section 2, and new methods of parameter estimation for several distributions. The theory of L-moments parallels the theory of (conventional) moments, as this list of applications might suggest. The main advantage of L-moments over conventional moments is that L-moments, being linear functions of the data, suffer less from the effects of sampling variability: L-moments are more robust than conventional moments to outliers in the data and enable more secure inferences to be made from small samples about an underlying probability distribution. L-moments sometimes yield more efficient parameter estimates than the maximum likelihood estimates.},

  abstract = {Antibodies and antibody-based drugs are currently the fastest-growing class of therapeutics. Over the last three decades, more than 30 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and derivatives thereof have been approved for and successfully applied in diverse indication areas including cancer, organ transplants, autoimmune/inflammatory disorders, and cardiovascular disease. The isotype of choice for antibody therapeutics is human IgG, whose Fc region contains a ubiquitous asparagine residue (N297) that acts as an acceptor site for N-linked glycans. The nature of these glycans can decisively influence the therapeutic performance of a recombinant antibody, and their absence or modification can lead to the loss of Fc effector functions, greater immunogenicity, and unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles. However, recent studies have shown that aglycosylated antibodies can be genetically engineered to display novel or enhanced effector functions and that favorable pharmacokinetic properties can be preserved. Furthermore, the ability to produce aglycosylated antibodies in lower eukaryotes and bacteria offers the potential to broaden and simplify the production platforms and avoid the problem of antibody heterogeneity, which occurs when mammalian cells are used for production. In this review, we discuss the importance of Fc glycosylation focusing on the use of aglycosylated and glyco-engineered antibodies as therapeutic proteins.},

  abstract = {Sharing of code supports reproducible research but fewer journals have policies on code sharing compared to data sharing, and there is little evidence on researchers’ attitudes and experiences with code sharing. Before introducing a stronger policy on sharing of code, the Editors and publisher of the journal PLOS Computational Biology wished to test, via an online survey, the suitability of a proposed mandatory code sharing policy with its community of authors. Previous research has established, in 2019, 41\% of papers in the journal linked to shared code. We also wanted to understand the potential impact of the proposed policy on authors' submissions to the journal, and their concerns about code sharing. We received 214 completed survey responses, all of whom had generated code in their research previously. 80\% had published in PLOS Computational Biology and 88\% of whom were based in Europe or North America. Overall, respondents reported they were more likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy and US researchers were more positive than the average for all respondents. Researchers whose main discipline is Medicine and Health sciences viewed the proposed policy less favourably, as did the most senior researchers (those with more than 100 publications) compared to early and mid-career researchers. The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71\% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32\% of these papers. The most common reasons for not sharing code previously are practical issues, which are unlikely to prevent compliance with the policy. A lack of time to share code was the most common reason. 22\% of respondents who had not shared their code in the past cited intellectual property (IP) concerns - a concern that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory code sharing policy. The results also imply that 18\% of the respondents’ previous publications did not have the associated code shared and IP concerns were not cited, suggesting more papers in the journal could share code. To remain inclusive of all researchers in the community, the policy was designed to allow researchers who can demonstrate they are legally restricted from sharing their code to be granted an exemption to public sharing of code. As a secondary goal of the survey we wanted to determine if researchers have unmet needs in their ability to share their own code, and to access other researchers' code. Consistent with our previous research on data sharing, we found potential opportunities for new products or features that support code accessibility or reuse. We found researchers were on average satisfied with their ability to share their own code, suggesting that offering new products or features to support sharing in the absence of a stronger policy would not increase the availability of code with the journal's publications.},

  abstract = {Abstract The capability of flow cytometry to offer rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells has made this technology indispensable for health research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box–Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis. © 2008 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

  abstract = {While meta-analysis has demonstrated increased statistical power and more robust estimations in studies, the application of this commonly accepted methodology to cytometry data has been challenging. Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of ten heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2,926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between demographic groups. Software is released to the public through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MetaCyto.html).},

  abstract = {Two modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual-level health outcomes in multilevel studies (subjects within neighborhoods). Random effects models (or mixed models) use maximum likelihood estimation. Population average models typically use a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. These methods are used in place of basic regression approaches because the health of residents in the same neighborhood may be correlated, thus violating independence assumptions made by traditional regression procedures. This violation is particularly relevant to estimates of the variability of estimates. Though the literature appears to favor the mixed-model approach, little theoretical guidance has been offered to justify this choice. In this paper, we review the assumptions behind the estimates and inference provided by these 2 approaches. We propose a perspective that treats regression models for what they are in most circumstances: reasonable approximations of some true underlying relationship. We argue in general that mixed models involve unverifiable assumptions on the datagenerating distribution, which lead to potentially misleading estimates and biased inference. We conclude that the estimation-equation approach of population average models provides a more useful approximation of the truth.},

  abstract = {We developed a flow cytometry-based assay, termed Differential Leukocyte Counting and Immunophenotyping in Cryopreserved Ex vivo whole blood (DLC-ICE), that allows quantification of absolute counts and frequencies of leukocyte subsets and measures expression of activation, phenotypic and functional markers. We evaluated the performance of the DLC-ICE assay by determining inter-operator variability for processing fresh whole blood (WB) from healthy donors collected at multiple clinical sites. In addition, we assessed inter-operator variability for staining of fixed cells and robustness across different anticoagulants. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing DLC-ICE measurements to real-time cell enumeration using an accredited hematology analyzer. Finally, we developed and tested the performance of a 27-colour immunophenotyping panel on cryopreserved fixed WB and compared results to matched fresh WB. Overall, we observed {$<$}20\% variability in absolute counts and frequencies of granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells) when fresh WB was collected in different anti-coagulant tubes, processed or stained by independent operators. Absolute cell counts measured across operators and anti-coagulants using the DLC-ICE method exhibited excellent correlation with the reference method, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, measured using a hematology analyzer (r2 {$>$} 0.9 for majority of measurements). A comparison of leukocyte immunophenotyping on fresh WB versus DLC-ICE processed blood yielded equivalent and linear results over a wide dynamic range (r2 = 0.94 over 10–104 cells/μL). These results demonstrate low variability across trained operators, high robustness, linearity and accuracy, supporting utility of the DLC-ICE assay for large cohort studies involving multiple clinical research sites.},

This trend calls for algorithms which are able to quickly process tens of millions of data points, to compare results across subjects or time points, and to provide easily actionable interpretations of the results. To this end, we created Tailor, a model-based clustering algorithm specialized for flow cytometry data. Our approach leverages a phenotype-aware binning scheme to provide a coarse model of the data, which is then refined using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. We benchmark Tailor using a simulation study and two flow cytometry data sets, and show that the results are robust to moderate departures from normality and inter-sample variation. Moreover, Tailor provides automated, non-overlapping annotations of its clusters, which facilitates interpretation of results and downstream analysis. Tailor is released as an R package, and the source code is publicly available at www.github.com/matei-ionita/Tailor.},

Under the assumption of joint normality of the two sets of variates, we give the asymptotic (large-sample) distributions of the various estimated reduced-rank regression coefficient matrices that are of interest. Approximate confidence bounds on the elements of these matrices are then suggested using either the appropriate asymptotic expressions or the jackknife technique.},

Sera were tested for titers of antibodies which bound to each of five purified mycobacterial antigens by enzyme immunoassay and for competition of binding to single epitopes, using six radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies directed toward corresponding molecules. The evaluation of diagnostic specificity was based on a positive score represented by titers above the cutoff point of 2 standard deviations above the mean titer of a control group. For smear-positive samples, the best sensitivity (83\%) was achieved by exclusive use of the 38-kilodalton (kDa) antigen or its corresponding monoclonal antibodies. For smear-negative samples, levels of antibodies binding to the 19-kDa antigen showed a lower sensitivity of 62\% compared with the control group or 38\% compared with the contact group. Titers of antibody binding to the 14-kDa antigen were raised in Mycobacterium bovis BCG-vaccinated contacts, indicating that the greatest potential of this antigen may be in the detection of infection in a population for which tuberculin testing is unreliable. The results demonstrated the differing antibody responses to each of the tested antigens and distinct associations with the stage of infection or disease.},

  abstract = {In machine learning, models capture intelligence from data using algorithms implemented on frameworks like TensorFlow. Models learn during the training phase; an iterative process in which parameters are tuned to improve the prediction accuracy. Software repositories are used to save the artifacts of model development so that they can be modified in subsequent releases and shared between development teams. Issues in saving the state of machine learning projects is different from standard software practices. Machine learning models are equivalent to binary executable programs and ideally one should be able to recreate the model from the information preserved in project repositories. Recreation of the model becomes necessary when there is a change in the development team as part of the product transition. Retraining of models also becomes necessary when the inaccuracy in the predictions made on new data increases beyond the acceptable limit. When traditional source code management systems are used for maintaining repositories of machine learning projects, we face challenges in keeping complete information required for model development starting from saved states. This paper presents the results of the studies conducted to identify the challenges in maintaining TensorFlow machine learning projects in repositories. Some of the existing tools are compared and recommendations are made to improve the ease of recreation of machine learning models by saving complete information in project repositories maintained in normal source code control systems.},

However, due to suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and retention in care, only 66\% of PWH in South Africa are virally suppressed. Standard care only allows for suboptimal adherence detection when routine testing indicates unsuppressed virus. Several adherence interventions are known to improve HIV outcomes, yet few are implemented in routinely due to the resources required. Therefore, determining scalable evidence-based adherence support interventions for resource-limited settings (RLS) is a priority. The multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework allows for simultaneous evaluation of multiple intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to identify the intervention combination with the highest levels of efficacy and cost-effectiveness that is feasible and acceptable in primary care clinics in Cape Town.},

  abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects” are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ({$>$}25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

  abstract = {Background: Flow cytometry is a widespread single-cell measurement technology with a multitude of clinical and research applications. Interpretation of flow cytometry data is hard; the instrumentation is delicate and can not render absolute measurements, hence samples can only be interpreted in relation to each other while at the same time comparisons are confounded by inter-sample variation. Despite this, most automated flow cytometry data analysis methods either treat samples individually or ignore the variation by for example pooling the data. A key requirement for models that include multiple samples is the ability to visualize and assess inferred variation, since what could be technical variation in one setting would be different phenotypes in another. Results: We introduce BayesFlow, a pipeline for latent modeling of flow cytometry cell populations built upon a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model systematizes variation in location as well as shape. Expert knowledge can be incorporated through informative priors and the results can be supervised through compact and comprehensive visualizations. BayesFlow is applied to two synthetic and two real flow cytometry data sets. For the first real data set, taken from the FlowCAP I challenge, BayesFlow does not only give a gating which would place it among the top performers in FlowCAP I for this dataset, it also gives a more consistent treatment of different samples than either manual gating or other automated gating methods. The second real data set contains replicated flow cytometry measurements of samples from healthy individuals. BayesFlow gives here cell populations with clear expression patterns and small technical intra-donor variation as compared to biological inter-donor variation. Conclusions: Modeling latent relations between samples through BayesFlow enables a systematic analysis of inter-sample variation. As opposed to other joint gating methods, effort is put at ensuring that the obtained partition of the data corresponds to actual cell populations, and the result is therefore directly biologically interpretable. BayesFlow is freely available at GitHub.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes using genetic algorithms (GA) for feature selection. Although the focus is on using this approach in linear regression, it can be extended to other machine learning methods. The GA approach is tailored to regression models and then compared to traditional feature selection using stepwise and lasso. In this research, emphasis is placed on finding the best feature subset among all possible combinations based upon the Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC. The approach is illustrated using a case study from fracking oil wells and simulations. The conclusion is that GA selection has great benefit for applying machine learning in applications with many nuisance features. GA selection is more likely to find the best model among all possible subsets. Constraints from model restrictions, data transformations, data encoding are naturally incorporated into the algorithm. Although the time needed to find the best solution is higher than shrinkage methods, in most cases it is acceptable when compared to the improved selection and confidence in the selected features. The case study and simulations used SAS® Enterprise Miner™ and Python.},

Methods: We recruited healthcare workers receiving the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at the Chiba University Hospital COVID-19 Vaccine Center. Blood samples were obtained before Journal Pre-proof the 1st dose and after the 2nd dose vaccination, and serum antibody titers were determined using Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2S, an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. We established a model to identify the baseline factors predicting post-vaccine antibody titers using univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: Two thousand fifteen individuals (median age 37-year-old, 64.3\% female) were enrolled in this study, of which 10 had a history of COVID-19. Before vaccination, 21 participants (1.1\%) had a detectable antibody titer (≥0.4 U/mL) with a median titer of 35.9 U/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 7.8 – 65.7). After vaccination, serum anti-SARS-CoV-2S antibodies (≥0.4 U/mL) were detected in all 1,774 participants who received the 2nd dose with a median titer of 2,060.0 U/mL (IQR 1,250.0 – 2,650.0). Immunosuppressive medication (p{$<$}0.001), age (p{$<$}0.001), time from 2nd dose to sample collection (p{$<$}0.001), glucocorticoids (p=0.020), and drinking alcohol (p=0.037) were identified as factors predicting lower antibody titers after vaccination, whereas previous COVID-19 (p{$<$}0.001), female (p{$<$}0.001), time between 2 doses (p{$<$}0.001), and medication for allergy (p=0.024) were identified as factors predicting higher serum antibody titers.

Infants were followed for 2 years to identify those who developed culture-positive TB—these infants were regarded as not protected against TB.

  abstract = {-RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is the fastest growing technology, as many IoT devices are communicating via RFID technology. During the interaction among RFID reader and tag, collision happens in different ways like tag-to-tag, reader-to-reader and reader-to-tag collisions. Several anti-collision techniques are presented to resolve the collision issue. The RFID reader is like a physical sensor; thus, this study shows how the context-aware process is used in the reader and tag interaction. Furthermore, the authors have discussed the context of RFID anti-collision protocol by analyzing how a reader reads a tag and detects collision from a context-aware perspective. This study examines the method of working of anti-collision techniques from a context-aware perspective. The study gives a brief overview of how an anti-collision technique is working in RFID reader and tag communication. The core focus of this study is to compare anti-collision techniques and examine from a context-aware perspective. In this paper, RFID reader and tag communication is mapped with a context-aware cycle. By examining anti-collision techniques as an outcome, efforts have been made in this paper to determine which anti-collision technique is working better from a context-aware perspective. As per our findings, the discontinuous collision bit mapping algorithm (DCCMA) is a better approach as compared to other anti-collision techniques. Through this paper, we have found out that (DCCMA) anti-collision technique is better from a context-aware perspective.},

In contrast, open-source software development involves the iterative development of a shared artifact through distributed collaboration using a version control system. In the interest of enabling collaborative and continual improvement of machine learning models, we introduce Git-Theta, a version control system for machine learning models. Git-Theta is an extension to Git, the most widely used version control software, that allows fine-grained tracking of changes to model parameters alongside code and other artifacts. Unlike existing version control systems that treat a model checkpoint as a blob of data, Git-Theta leverages the structure of checkpoints to support communication-efficient updates, automatic model merges, and meaningful reporting about the difference between two versions of a model. In addition, Git-Theta includes a plug-in system that enables users to easily add support for new functionality. In this paper, we introduce Git-Theta's design and features and include an example use-case of Git-Theta where a pre-trained model is continually adapted and modified. We publicly release Git-Theta in hopes of kickstarting a new era of collaborative model development.},

  abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most widely used drug platforms for infectious diseases or cancer therapeutics because they selectively target pathogens, infectious cells, cancerous cells, and even immune cells. In this way, they mediate the elimination of target molecules and cells with fewer side effects than other therapeutic modalities. In particular, cancer therapeutic mAbs can recognize cell-surface proteins on target cells and then kill the targeted cells by multiple mechanisms that are dependent upon a fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain interacting with effector Fc gamma receptors, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellmediated phagocytosis. Extensive engineering efforts have been made toward tuning Fc functions by either reinforcing (e.g. for targeted therapy) or disabling (e.g. for immune checkpoint blockade therapy) effector functions and prolonging the serum half-lives of antibodies, as necessary. In this report, we review Fc engineering efforts to improve therapeutic potency, and propose future antibody engineering directions that can fulfill unmet medical needs.},

ML methods are often applied and fail in similar ways across disciplines. Motivated by this observation, our goal is to provide clear reporting standards for ML-based science.

It consists of 32 questions and a paired set of guidelines.

  abstract = {Machine-learning (ML) methods have gained prominence in the quantitative sciences. However, there are many known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. We systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based science. Through a survey of literature in fields that have adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields where leakage has been found, collectively affecting 294 papers and, in some cases, leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we introduce a detailed taxonomy of eight types of leakage, ranging from textbook errors to open research problems. We propose that researchers test for each type of leakage by filling out model info sheets, which we introduce. Finally, we conduct a reproducibility study of civil war prediction, where complex ML models are believed to vastly outperform traditional statistical models such as logistic regression (LR). When the errors are corrected, complex ML models do not perform substantively better than decades-old LR models.},

  abstract = {The assessment of antigen-specific T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) has become a routine technique in studies of vaccination and immunity. Here, we highlight how the duration of in vitro antigen pre-stimulation, combined with the cytokine accumulation period, are critical parameters of these methods. The effect of varying these parameters upon the diversity and frequency of multifunctional CD4 T cell subsets has been investigated using a murine model of TB vaccination and in cattle naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis. We demonstrate a substantial influence of the duration of the antigen pre-stimulation period on the repertoire of the antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses. Increasing prestimulation from 2 to 6 hours amplified the diversity of the seven potential multifunctional CD4 T cell subsets that secreted any combination of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a. However, increasing pre-stimulation from 6 to 16 hours markedly altered the multifunctional CD4 T cell repertoire to a dominant IFN-c+ only response. This was observed in both murine and cattle models. Whilst these data are of particular relevance to the measurement of vaccine and infection induced immunity in TB, more generally, they demonstrate the importance of the empirical determination of the optimum duration of the individual culture steps of ICS assays for any model. We highlight the potential significance of variations in these parameters, particularly when comparing data between studies and/or models including clinical trials.},

The present paper proposes several techniques for simple structure rotation of a PCAMIX solution based on the rotation of component scores and indicates how these can be viewed as generalizations of the simple structure methods for PCA. In addition, a recently developed technique for the analysis of mixtures of qualitative and quantitative variables, called INDOMIX, is shown to construct component scores (without rotational freedom) maximizing the quartimax criterion over all possible sets of component scores. A numerical example is used to illustrate the implication that when used for qualitative variables, INDOMIX provides axes that discriminate between the observation units better than do those generated from MCA.},

Sex differences in the responses to vaccines are observed across diverse age groups, ranging from infants to aged individuals. Biological as well as behavioral differences between the sexes are likely to contribute to differences in the outcome of vaccination between the sexes. Immunological, hormonal, genetic and microbiota differences between males and females may also affect the outcome of vaccination.

As their impact permeates, many architectural designs in networking, computing and storage have to be rethought because this affects the conventional way of running and deploying applications. The urge to save costs in this rapidly changing technological era, have operators continually searching for better methods. This paper extends the work previously conducted on Fragmentation-based distributed control system for Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSN). The system entails a two-level architecture comprising local controllers and a global controller to overcome the geographical space between the infrastructure elements and the controller. This was in response for a better control system for SDWSNs, given their distinct nature. The paper explores different methods of infrastructure deployment for this model, contrasting virtual machines (VMs) and containers. The design of the Fragmentation model is such that the local controllers are lean and inexpensive. The evaluation shows that software containers are faster and more efficient as compared to the VMs and the infrastructure deployment method do contribute to the efficiency of the model.},

One result of this is that the self-organization process can discover semantic relationships in sentences. Brain maps, semantic maps, and early work on competitive learning are reviewed. The self-organizing map algorithm (an algorithm which order responses spatially) is reviewed, focusing on best matching cell selection and adaptation of the weight vectors. Suggestions for applying the self-organizing map algorithm, demonstrations of the ordering process, and an example of hierarchical clustering of data are presented. Fine tuning the map by learning vector quantization is addressed. The use of self-organized maps in practical speech recognition and a simulation experiment on semantic mapping are discussed.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Background: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as “informative covariates” to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Results: Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Conclusions: Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

In the scientific software context, CI can serve two functions to increase reproducibility of scientific results: providing an established platform for testing the reproducibility of these results, and demonstrating to other scientists how the code and data generate the published results. We explore scientific software testing and CI strategies using two articles published in the areas of applied mathematics and computational physics. We discuss lessons learned from reproducing these articles as well as examine and discuss existing tests. We introduce the notion of a "scientific test" as one that produces computational results from a published article. We then consider full result reproduction within a CI environment. If authors find their work too time or resource intensive to easily adapt to a CI context, we recommend the inclusion of results from reduced versions of their work (e.g., run at lower resolution, with shorter time scales, with smaller data sets) alongside their primary results within their article. While these smaller versions may be less interesting scientifically, they can serve to verify that published code and data are working properly. We demonstrate such reduction tests on the two articles studied.},

In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {Background: Ratios of bacteriologically positive tuberculosis (TB) prevalence to notification rates are used to characterise typical durations of TB disease. However, this ignores the clinical spectrum of tuberculosis disease and potentially long infectious periods with minimal or no symptoms prior to care-seeking. Methods: We developed novel statistical models to estimate progression from initial bacteriological positivity including smear conversion, symptom onset and initial care-seeking. Case-detection ratios, TB incidence, durations, and other parameters were estimated by fitting the model to tuberculosis prevalence survey and notification data (one subnational and 11 national datasets) within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results: Analysis across 11 national datasets found asymptomatic tuberculosis durations in the range 4–8 months for African countries; three countries in Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Philippines) showed longer durations of {$>$} 1 year. For the six countries with relevant data, care-seeking typically began half-way between symptom onset and notification. For Kenya and Blantyre, Malawi, individual-level data were available. The sex-specific durations of asymptomatic bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 9.0 months (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 7.2–11.2) for men and 8.1 months (95\% CrI: 6.2–10.3) for women in Kenya, and 4.9 months (95\% CrI: 2.6–7.9) for men and 3.5 months (95\% CrI: 1.3–6.2) for women in Blantyre. Age-stratified analysis of data for Kenya showed no strong agedependence in durations. For Blantyre, HIV-stratified analysis estimated an asymptomatic duration of 1.3 months (95\% CrI: 0.3–3.0) for HIV-positive people, shorter than the 8.5 months (95\% CrI: 5.0–12.7) for HIV-negative people. Additionally, case-detection ratios were higher for people living with HIV than HIV-negative people (93\% vs 71\%). Conclusion: Asymptomatic TB disease typically lasts around 6 months. We found no evidence of age-dependence, but much shorter durations among people living with HIV, and longer durations in some Asian settings. To eradicate TB transmission, greater gains may be achieved by proactively screening people without symptoms through active case finding interventions},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A national survey of tuberculosis notifications in England and Wales was carried out in 1993 to determine the notification rate of tuberculosis and the trends in the occurrence of disease by ethnic group in comparison with the findings of similar surveys in 1978/79, 1983, and 1988. The prevalence of HIV infection in adults notified with tuberculosis in the survey period was also estimated. METHODS: Clinical, bacteriological, and sociodemographic information was obtained on all newly notified cases of tuberculosis in England and Wales during the six months from 2 January to 2 July 1993. The prevalence of HIV infection in 16-54 year old patients with tuberculosis notified throughout 1993 was assessed using "unlinked anonymous" testing supplemented by matching of the register of patients with tuberculosis with that of patients with AIDS reported to the PHLS AIDS centre. Annual notification rates were calculated using population estimates from the 1993 Labour Force Survey. RESULTS: A total of 2706 newly notified patients was eligible for inclusion in the survey of whom 2458 were previously untreated the comparable figures for 1988 were 2408 and 2163. The number of patients of white ethnic origin decreased from 1142 (53\%) in 1988 to 1088 (44\%) in 1993 whereas those of patients of Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi (Indian subcontinent (ISC)) ethnic origin increased from 843 (39\%) in 1988 to 1014 (41\%) and those of "other" (non-white, non-ISC) ethnic origins increased from 178 (8\%) to 356 (14\%). The largest increase was seen in the black African ethnic group from 37 in 1988 to 171 in 1993. Forty nine per cent of patients had been born abroad and the highest rates were seen in those who had recently arrived in this country. The overall annual notification rate for previously untreated tuberculosis in England and Wales increased between 1988 and 1993 from 8.4 to 9.2 per 100,000 population. The rate declined in the white, Indian, and black Caribbean ethnic groups and increased in all other groups. In the white group the rate of decline has slowed since the last survey: in several age groups the rates were higher in 1993 than 1988 but the numbers in these groups were small. Thirty six (4.1\%) of the 882 previously untreated respiratory cases were resistant to isoniazid and three (0.3\%) to isoniazid and rifampicin. Sixty two (2.3\%) adults aged 16-54 years were estimated to be HIV-infected. Evidence of under-reporting of HIV positive tuberculosis patients was found. CONCLUSIONS: The number of cases and annual notification rate for previously untreated tuberculosis increased between 1988 and 1993. Although the decline in rates in the white population has continued, the rate of decline has slowed. The high rates in the ISC ethnic group population have continued to decline since 1988 whereas rates in the black African group have increased. An increased proportion of cases were found among people born abroad, particularly those recently arrived in this country. In previously untreated cases the level of drug resistance remains low and multi-drug resistance is rare. A small proportion of adults with tuberculosis were infected with HIV but there may be selective undernotification of tuberculosis in these patients.},

  abstract = {NK cells play an important role in the control of tuberculosis infection: they are not only able to kill the infected cells, but also control the activity of macrophages and development of the adaptive immune response. Still, there is little information on the role of specific NK cell subsets in this network. In this study, we focused on the mycobacteria-driven responses of the NK cells expressing HLA-DR – a type of MHC class II. We have revealed that this subset is increased in the peripheral blood of patients with primary diagnosed tuberculosis, and expands in response to               in vitro               stimulation with ultrasonically destroyed               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               cells (sonicate). The expanded HLA-DR               +               NK cells had less differentiated phenotype, higher proliferative activity and increased expression of NKp30 and NKp46 receptors. HLA-DR               +               CD56               dim               NK cells showed higher IFNγ production and degranulation level than the respective HLA-DR               −               NK cells in response to both 24~h and 7 day stimulation with sonicate, while HLA-DR               +               CD56               bright               NK cells mostly demonstarted similar high responsiveness to the same stimulating conditions as their HLA-DR               −               CD56               bright               counterparts. After preliminary incubation with destroyed mycobacteria, cytokine-activated HLA-DR-expressing NK cells were able to mediate mycobacteria-induced and HLA-DR-dependent cytokine production in autologous CD4               +               T cells. Thus, functionally active HLA-DR               +               cells seem to be one of the NK cell subsets providing an important link to the adaptive immunity.},

  abstract = {The BCG vaccine is a widely given vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), yet studies on effectiveness have shown considerable heterogeneity; as a result, BCG vaccine policies vary greatly across the globe and change across geography, and with time and disease burden. The recently updated third BCG World Atlas (www.bcgatlas.org) is a publicly available online database with information on BCG practices across 194 countries. This helpful resource has been used for over 10 years to support clinicians, TB researchers and TB vaccine development worldwide. Here, we summarise main findings from the third BCG Atlas’ most recent update which included additional data collected around BCG strain type, vaccine stockouts and associated changes. Longitudinal analysis enables evaluation of changes in TB incidence over time, a method becoming more common in legislation interventions. A large number of countries in the BCG Atlas (156/194 countries) maintain universal neonatal BCG vaccination, of which 51 are considered low TB burden countries. We demonstrate the majority of countries who changed their national policy moved to targeted vaccination for high-­risk groups, were in Europe and also had significant decreases in TB incidence both before and after policy change. Globally, the most common BCG strain continues to be the Danish strain, despite its worldwide manufacturing interruption in 2015. Substantial variation and disproportionality exists in which regions were most affected by stockouts between 2009 and 2019. Tracking and understanding the reasoning behind changes to national BCG practices and their impact on TB burden is critical for decision makers as they contemplate how to include BCG vaccination in future immunisation guidelines in low and high TB burden countries.},

In the ubiquitous negative binomial model for RNA-seq data, each gene is given a dispersion parameter, and correctly estimating these dispersion parameters is vital to detecting differential expression. Since the dispersions control the variances of the gene counts, underestimation may lead to false discovery, while overestimation may lower the rate of true detection. After briefly reviewing several popular dispersion estimation methods, this article describes a simulation study that compares them in terms of point estimation and the effect on the performance of tests for differential expression. The methods that maximize the test performance are the ones that use a moderate degree of dispersion shrinkage: the DSS, Tagwise wqCML, and Tagwise APL. In practical RNA-seq data analysis, we recommend using one of these moderate-shrinkage methods with the QLShrink test in QuasiSeq R package.},

  abstract = {Motivation Recent advances in mass cytometry allow simultaneous measurements of up to 50 markers at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality of mass cytometry data introduces computational challenges for automated data analysis and hinders translation of new biological understanding into clinical applications. Previous studies have applied machine learning to facilitate processing of mass cytometry data. However, manual inspection is still inevitable and becoming the barrier to reliable large-scale analysis. Results We present a new algorithm called Automated Cell-type Discovery and Classification (ACDC) that fully automates the classification of canonical cell populations and highlights novel cell types in mass cytometry data. Evaluations on real-world data show ACDC provides accurate and reliable estimations compared to manual gating results. Additionally, ACDC automatically classifies previously ambiguous cell types to facilitate discovery. Our findings suggest that ACDC substantially improves both reliability and interpretability of results obtained from high-dimensional mass cytometry profiling data. Availability and Implementation A Python package (Python 3) and analysis scripts for reproducing the results are availability on https://bitbucket.org/dudleylab/acdc. Supplementary information  are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Computational methods for identification of cell populations from polychromatic flow cytometry data are changing the paradigm of cytometry bioinformatics. Data clustering is the most common computational approach to unsupervised identification of cell populations from multidimensional cytometry data. However, interpretation of the identified data clusters is labor-intensive. Certain types of user-defined cell populations are also difficult to identify by fully automated data clustering analysis. Both are roadblocks before a cytometry lab can adopt the data clustering approach for cell population identification in routine use. We found that combining recursive data filtering and clustering with constraints converted from the user manual gating strategy can effectively address these two issues. We named this new approach DAFi: Directed Automated Filtering and Identification of cell populations. Design of DAFi preserves the data-driven characteristics of unsupervised clustering for identifying novel cell subsets, but also makes the results interpretable to experimental scientists through mapping and merging the multidimensional data clusters into the user-defined two-dimensional gating hierarchy. The recursive data filtering process in DAFi helped identify small data clusters which are otherwise difficult to resolve by a single run of the data clustering method due to the statistical interference of the irrelevant major clusters. Our experiment results showed that the proportions of the cell populations identified by DAFi, while being consistent with those by expert centralized manual gating, have smaller technical variances across samples than those from individual manual gating analysis and the nonrecursive data clustering analysis. Compared with manual gating segregation, DAFi-identified cell populations avoided the abrupt cut-offs on the boundaries. DAFi has been implemented to be used with multiple data clustering methods including K-means, FLOCK, FlowSOM, and the ClusterR package. For cell population identification, DAFi supports multiple options including clustering, bisecting, slope-based gating, and reversed filtering to meet various autogating needs from different scientific use cases. © 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the widespread use of the only licensed vaccine, Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG). Eradication of TB will require a more effective vaccine, yet evaluation of new vaccine candidates is hampered by lack of defined correlates of protection. Animal and human studies of intracellular pathogens have extensively evaluated polyfunctional CD4+ T cells producing multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2) as a possible correlate of protection from infection and disease. In this study, we review the published literature that evaluates whether or not BCG and/or novel TB vaccine candidates induce polyfunctional CD4+ T cells and if these T cell responses correlate with vaccine-mediated protection. Ample evidence suggests that BCG and several novel vaccine candidates evaluated in animal models and humans induce polyfunctional CD4+ T cells. However, while a number of studies utilizing the mouse TB model support that polyfunctional CD4+ T cells are associated with vaccine-induced protection, other studies in mouse and human infants demonstrate no correlation between these T cell responses and protection. We conclude that induction of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells is certainly not sufficient and may not even be necessary to mediate protection and suggest that other functional attributes, such as additional effector functions, T cell differentiation state, tissue homing potential, or long-term survival capacity of the T cell may be equally or more important to promote protection. Thus, a correlate of protection for TB vaccine development remains elusive. Future studies should address polyfunctional CD4+ T cells within the context of more comprehensive immunological signatures of protection that include other functions and phenotypes of T cells as well as the full spectrum of immune cells and mediators that participate in the immune response against Mtb.},

  abstract = {Background: Stability of multiple testing procedures, defined as the standard deviation of total number of discoveries, can be used as an indicator of variability of multiple testing procedures. Improving stability of multiple testing procedures can help to increase the consistency of findings from replicated experiments. Benjamini-Hochberg’s and Storey’s q-value procedures are two commonly used multiple testing procedures for controlling false discoveries in genomic studies. Storey’s q-value procedure has higher power and lower stability than Benjamini-Hochberg’s procedure. To improve upon the stability of Storey’s q-value procedure and maintain its high power in genomic data analysis, we propose a new multiple testing procedure, named Bon-EV, to control false discovery rate (FDR) based on Bonferroni’s approach. Results: Simulation studies show that our proposed Bon-EV procedure can maintain the high power of the Storey’s q-value procedure and also result in better FDR control and higher stability than Storey’s q-value procedure for samples of large size(30 in each group) and medium size (15 in each group) for either independent, somewhat correlated, or highly correlated test statistics. When sample size is small (5 in each group), our proposed Bon-EV procedure has performance between the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and the Storey’s q-value procedure. Examples using RNA-Seq data show that the Bon-EV procedure has higher stability than the Storey’s q-value procedure while maintaining equivalent power, and higher power than the Benjamini-Hochberg’s procedure. Conclusions: For medium or large sample sizes, the Bon-EV procedure has improved FDR control and stability compared with the Storey’s q-value procedure and improved power compared with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The Bon-EV multiple testing procedure is available as the BonEV package in R for download at https:// CRAN.R-project.org/package=BonEV.},

The analysis of RNA-seq data at four different levels (samples, genes, transcripts, and exons) involve multiple statistical and computational questions, some of which remain challenging up to date. Results: We review RNA-seq analysis tools at the sample, gene, transcript, and exon levels from a statistical perspective. We also highlight the biological and statistical questions of most practical considerations. Conclusions: The development of statistical and computational methods for analyzing RNA-seq data has made significant advances in the past decade. However, methods developed to answer the same biological question often rely on diverse statistical models and exhibit different performance under different scenarios. This review discusses and compares multiple commonly used statistical models regarding their assumptions, in the hope of helping users select appropriate methods as needed, as well as assisting developers for future method development.},

  author = {Liang, Kung-Yee and Zeger, Scott L},
  abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of generalized linear models to the analysis of longitudinal data. We introduce a class of estimating equations that give consistent estimates of the regression parameters and of their variance under mild assumptions about the time dependence. The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for multivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

  abstract = {We have adopted an open bioinformatics ecosystem to address the challenges of bioinformatics implementation in public health laboratories (PHLs). Bioinformatics implementation for public health requires practitioners to undertake standardized bioinformatic analyses and generate reproducible, validated and auditable results. It is essential that data storage and analysis are scalable, portable and secure, and that implementation of bioinformatics fits within the operational constraints of the laboratory. We address these requirements using Terra, a web-based data analysis platform with a graphical user interface connecting users to bioinformatics analyses without the use of code. We have developed bioinformatics workflows for use with Terra that specifically meet the needs of public health practitioners. These Theiagen workflows perform genome assembly, quality control, and characterization, as well as construction of phylogeny for insights into genomic epidemiology. Additonally, these workflows use open-source containerized software and the WDL workflow language to ensure standardization and interoperability with other bioinformatics solutions, whilst being adaptable by the user. They are all open source and publicly available in Dockstore with the version-controlled code available in public GitHub repositories. They have been written to generate outputs in standardized file formats to allow for further downstream analysis and visualization with separate genomic epidemiology software. Testament to this solution meeting the requirements for bioinformatic implementation in public health, Theiagen workflows have collectively been used for over 5 million sample analyses in the last 2\,years by over 90 public health laboratories in at least 40 different countries. Continued adoption of technological innovations and development of further workflows will ensure that this ecosystem continues to benefit PHLs.},

We present several recent parametric and nonparametric Bayesian mixture modeling approaches, and describe advantages and limitations of these models under different research context for cytometry data analysis. We also acknowledge current computational challenges associated with the use of Bayesian mixture models for analysing cytometry data, and we draw attention to recent developments in advanced numerical algorithms for estimating large Bayesian mixture models, which we believe have the potential to make Bayesian mixture model more applicable to new types of single-cell data with higher dimensions.},

Efficient implementations of t-SNE are available, but they scale poorly to datasets with hundreds of thousands to millions of high dimensional data-points. We present Fast Fourier Transform-accelerated Interpolation-based t-SNE (FIt-SNE), which dramatically accelerates the computation of t-SNE. The most time-consuming step of t-SNE is a convolution that we accelerate by interpolating onto an equispaced grid and subsequently using the fast Fourier transform to perform the convolution. We also optimize the computation of input similarities in high dimensions using multi-threaded approximate nearest neighbors. We further present a modification to t-SNE called "late exaggeration," which allows for easier identification of clusters in t-SNE embeddings. Finally, for datasets that cannot be loaded into the memory, we present out-of-core randomized principal component analysis (oocPCA), so that the top principal components of a dataset can be computed without ever fully loading the matrix, hence allowing for t-SNE of large datasets to be computed on resource-limited machines.},

  abstract = {This paper considers multiple imputation (MI) approaches for handling non-monotone missing longitudinal binary responses when estimating parameters of a marginal model using generalized estimating equations (GEE). GEE has been shown to yield consistent estimates of the regression parameters for a marginal model when data are missing completely at random (MCAR). However, when data are missing at random (MAR), the GEE estimates may not be consistent; the MI approaches proposed in this paper minimize bias under MAR. The first MI approach proposed is based on a multivariate normal distribution, but with the addition of pairwise products among the binary outcomes to the multivariate normal vector. Even though the multivariate normal does not impute 0 or 1 values for the missing binary responses, as discussed by Horton et al. (Am Stat 57:229–232, 2003), we suggest not rounding when filling in the missing binary data because it could increase bias. The second MI approach considered is the fully conditional specification (FCS) approach. In this approach, we specify a logistic regression model for each outcome given the outcomes at other time points and the covariates. Typically, one would only include main effects of the outcome at the other times as predictors in the FCS approach, but we explore if bias can be reduced by also including pairwise interactions of the outcomes at other time point in the FCS. In a study of asymptotic bias with non-monotone missing data, the proposed MI approaches are also compared to GEE without imputation. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated using data from a longitudinal clinical trial comparing four psychosocial treatments from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Collaborative Cocaine Treatment Study, where patients’ cocaine use is collected monthly for 6~months during treatment.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed as an attenuated live vaccine for tuberculosis control nearly a century ago. Despite being the most widely used vaccine in human history, the mechanisms of attenuation of BCG remain poorly understood. BCG is not a single organism, but comprises a number of substrains that differ in genotypes and phenotypes. The impacts of these differences on BCG vaccine properties are largely unknown. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the development of sophisticated genome analysis techniques, coupled with advances in knowledge of the virulence mechanisms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have provided greater insights into the attenuation and evolution of BCG. This review article discusses these new developments, focusing on molecular mechanisms that contribute to the attenuation of BCG substrains. It is evident that BCG strains comprise natural mutants of major virulence factors of M. tb, including ESX-1, PDIM/PGL, and PhoP, and that BCG substrains differ markedly in virulence level. The impacts of these findings on vaccine properties including adverse reaction effect, tuberculin reactivity, and protective efficacy are discussed. These new insights have extremely important implications for national immunization programmes and the development of future vaccines.}

We used high-dose IV BCG recipients for “discovery” and validated our findings in low-dose recipients and in an independent cohort of macaques receiving BCG via different routes. We identified seven vaccine-induced gene modules, including an innate module (module 1) enriched for type 1 interferon and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. Module 1 on day 2 post-vaccination was highly correlated with lung antigen-responsive CD4 T cells at week 8 and with Mtb and granuloma burden following challenge. Parsimonious signatures within module 1 at day 2 post-vaccination predicted protection following challenge with AUROCs  0.91. Together these results indicate that the early innate transcriptional response to IV BCG in peripheral blood may provide a robust correlate of protection against TB.},

  abstract = {Fisher’s (protected) least significant difference (LSD) procedure has been suggested in the design and analysis of multiarm clinical trials with survival endpoints. In this article, the power of this procedure is evaluated and compared with that of Bonferroni and Hochberg procedures by Monte Carlo simulations under three scenarios of alternative hypothesis encountered in three arm clinical trials with survival endpoint. The approach of sample size calculation based on the power of a global test in the first step of Fisher’s LSD procedure is also evaluated and contrasted with that based on Bonferroni adjustment. It is shown that Bonferroni and Hochberg procedures are more powerful than Fisher’s LSD procedure when two specific pair-wise comparisons are of interest, while Fisher’s LSD procedure is the most powerful if all three pairwise comparisons are performed. It is recommended that the formula of Makuch and Simon be used in the sample size calculations for all three types of alternative hypothesis considered in this article. However, the Hochberg procedure should be used in the analysis if only two specific pairwise comparisons are of interest and the Fisher’s LSD procedure should be used in the analysis when objective of the trial includes all of three pairwise comparisons.},

  abstract = {The risk of tuberculosis (TB) disease is higher in individuals with recent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection compared to individuals with more remote, established infection. We aimed to define blood-based biomarkers to distinguish between recent and remote infection, which would allow targeting of recently infected individuals for preventive TB treatment. We hypothesized that integration of multiple immune measurements would outperform the diagnostic performance of a single biomarker. Analysis was performed on different components of the immune system, including adaptive and innate responses to mycobacteria, measured on recently and remotely M.tb infected adolescents. The datasets were standardized using variance stabilizing scaling and missing values were imputed using a multiple factor analysis-based approach. For data integration, we compared the performance of a Multiple Tuning Parameter Elastic Net (MTP-EN) to a standard EN model, which was built to the individual adaptive and innate datasets. Biomarkers with non-zero coefficients from the optimal single data EN models were then isolated to build logistic regression models. A decision tree and random forest model were used for statistical confirmation. We found no difference in the predictive performances of the optimal MTP-EN model and the EN model [average area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) = 0.93]. EN models built to the integrated dataset and the adaptive dataset yielded identically high AUROC values (average AUROC = 0.91), while the innate data EN model performed poorly (average AUROC = 0.62). Results also indicated that integration of adaptive and innate biomarkers did not outperform the adaptive biomarkers alone (Likelihood Ratio Test χ2 = 6.09, p = 0.808). From a total of 193 variables, the level of HLA-DR on ESAT6/CFP10-specific Th1 cytokine-expressing CD4 cells was the strongest biomarker for recent M.tb infection.

  abstract = {The capability of flow cytometry to offer rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells has made this technology indispensable for health research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box–Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis. © 2008 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

  abstract = {While a third of the world carries the burden of tuberculosis, disease control has been hindered by a lack of tools, including a rapid, point-of-care diagnostic and a protective vaccine. In many infectious diseases, antibodies (Abs) are powerful biomarkers and important immune mediators. However, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, a discriminatory or protective role for humoral immunity remains unclear. Using an unbiased antibody profiling approach, we show that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (Ltb) and active tuberculosis disease (Atb) have distinct Mtb-specific humoral responses, such that Ltb infection is associated with unique Ab Fc functional profiles, selective binding to FcgRIII, and distinct Ab glycosylation patterns. Moreover, compared to Abs from Atb, Abs from Ltb drove enhanced phagolysosomal maturation, inflammasome activation, and, most importantly, macrophage killing of intracellular Mtb. Combined, these data point to a potential role for Fc-mediated Ab effector functions, tuned via differential glycosylation, in Mtb control.},

  abstract = {Background An effective adult vaccine is needed to control tuberculosis. We evaluated safety and immunogenicity of a live-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) vaccine (MTBVAC). Methods This randomized, double-blind, BCG-controlled, dose-escalation trial (NCT02933281) conducted between January 15, 2019, and September 07, 2020, enrolled previously BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, South African adults, aged 18-50 years, with/without Mtb sensitisation assessed by QuantiFERON-TB Gold-Plus assay (QFT). Participants were randomised (1:2) to BCG revaccination (5×10⁵ CFU dose; 24 QFT-negative, 24 QFT-positive) or MTBVAC (5×103, 5×104, 5×105, or 5x106 CFU doses; 12 QFTnegative, 12 QFT-positive). Safety outcomes included local and systemic adverse events (AE) within 7, 28, and 84 days and serious adverse events (SAE) within 365 days. Immunogenicity outcomes included frequencies of Th1 cytokine-expressing MTBVAC-specific CD4 T cells measured by intracellular cytokine staining and IFNlevels measured by QFT. Results Among 485 volunteers screened,144 were enrolled (38.5\% female). Injection site pain, discharge, erythema, and swelling increased with MTBVAC dose level. MTBVAC 5×105 CFU recipients reported a similar rate of related AE (23/24; 95.8\%) as BCG recipients (45/47; 95.7\%). QFT-positive MTBVAC recipients reported more injection site reactions [46/48; 95.5\% (95\%CI 85.7-99.5\%)] than QFT-negative MTBVAC recipients [32/48; 66.6\% (95\%CI 51.6-79.6\%)]. No vaccine-related SAE were reported. All doses of MTBVAC were immunogenic; vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses peaked 28 days post-vaccination. MTBVAC 5×105 and 5×106 CFU doses induced Th1 cytokine-expressing CD4 T cell responses that exceeded BCG-induced responses in QFT-negative and QFT-positive participants. QFT conversion was observed at day 28 in {$>$}50\% of baseline QFT-negative MTBVAC recipients vaccinated with the 3 highest doses of MTBVAC, but most reverted to QFT-negative by 365 days. Conclusion MTBVAC showed safety and reactogenicity comparable to BCG at the 5×105 CFU dose. At an equivalent dose, MTBVAC was more immunogenic than BCG in adults with/without prior Mtb sensitisation.},

  abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) prevails among more than 90\% of the adult population worldwide. Most primary infections occur during young childhood and cause no or only nonspecific symptoms; then the virus becomes latent and resides in lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Inactive latent EBV usually causes no serious consequences, but once it becomes active it can cause a wide spectrum of malignancies: epithelial tumors such as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinomas; mesenchymal tumors such as follicular dendritic cell tumor/sarcoma; and lymphoid malignancies such as Burkitt lymphoma, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, pyothorax-associated lymphoma, immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, extranodal natural killer (NK) cell/Tcell lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The purpose of this article is to describe the spectrum of EBV-related diseases and their key imaging findings. EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphomas are especially common in immunocompromised patients.},

  abstract = {Methods: Adolescents aged 12–18 years were recruited from high schools in the study area. At baseline, blood was drawn for QFT and a TST administered. Participants were followed up for up to 3.8 years for incident TB disease (median 2.4 years). Results: After exclusions, 5244 (82.4\%) of 6,363 adolescents enrolled, were analysed. The TB incidence rate was 0.60 cases per 100 person years (pyrs) (95\% CI 0.43–0.82) for baseline TST positive (\$5 mm) participants and 0.64 cases per 100 pyrs (95\% CI 0.45–0.87) for baseline QFT positive participants. TB incidence rates were 0.22 per 100 pyrs (0.11–0.39) and 0.22 per 100 pyrs (0.12–0.38) among those with a negative baseline TST and QFT respectively. Sensitivity for incident TB disease was 76.9\% for TST and 75.0\% for QFT (p = 0.81). Positive predictive value was 1.4\% for TST and 1.5\% for QFT. Conclusion: Positive TST and QFT tests were moderately sensitive predictors of progression to microbiologically confirmed TB disease. There was no significant difference in the predictive ability of these tests for TB disease amongst adolescents in this high burden setting. Therefore, these findings do not support use of QFT in preference to TST to predict the risk of TB disease in this study population.},

It elaborates on the methodology of multidimensional scaling problems (MDS) solved by means of the majorization algorithm. The objective function to be minimized is known as stress and functions which majorize stress are elaborated. This strategy to solve MDS problems is called SMACOF and it is implemented in an R package of the same name which is presented in this article. We extend the basic SMACOF theory in terms of configuration constraints, three-way data, unfolding models, and projection of the resulting configurations onto spheres and other quadratic surfaces. Various examples are presented to show the possibilities of the SMACOF approach offered by the corresponding package.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have brought advances in statistical theory for missing data, which, combined with advances in computing ability, have allowed implementation of a wide array of analyses. In fact, so many methods are available that it can be difficult to ascertain when to use which method. This book focuses on the prevention and treatment of missing data in longitudinal clinical trials. Based on his extensive experience with missing data, the author offers advice on choosing analysis methods and on ways to prevent missing data through appropriate trial design and conduct. He offers a practical guide to key principles and explains analytic methods for the non-statistician using limited statistical notation and jargon. The book's goal is to present a comprehensive strategy for preventing and treating missing data, and to make available the programs used to conduct the analyses of the example dataset.},

  abstract = {The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM) algorithm has shown its potential for performing several tasks such as exploratory analysis, anomaly detection and forecasting on a variety of domains including the financial and cyber-security domains. GHSOM is a dynamic variant of the SOM algorithm which generates a multi-level hierarchy of SOM maps based solely on input data. However, in order to generate this multi-level structure, GHSOM requires multiple iterations over the input dataset, thus making it intractable on large datasets. Moreover, the conventional GHSOM algorithm is designed to handle datasets with numeric attributes only. This represents an important limitation as most modern real-world datasets are characterized by mixed attributes - numerical and categorical. In this work, we propose an extension of the conventional GHSOM algorithm called Spark-GHSOM, which exploits the Spark platform to process massive datasets in a distributed manner. Moreover, we leverage a method known as the distance hierarchy approach to modify the optimization function of GHSOM so that it can (also) coherently handle mixed-attribute datasets. We test our new method with respect to accuracy, scalability and descriptive power. The results obtained using different datasets demonstrate the superior predictive and descriptive capabilities of Spark-GHSOM, as well as its applicability to large-scale datasets which could not be analyzed before.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) has been exploited to visualise the hidden structures among a set of entities in a reduced dimensional metric space. Here, we are interested in cases whenever the initial dissimilarity matrix is contaminated by outliers. It is well-known that the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the MDS problem generate erroneous embeddings due to the distortion introduced by such outliers. To remedy this vulnerability, a unified framework for the solution of MDS problem is proposed, which resorts to half-quadratic optimization and employs potential functions of M-estimators in combination with ℓ2,1 norm regularization. Two novel algorithms are derived. Their performance is assessed for various M-estimators against state-of-the-art MDS algorithms on four benchmark data sets. The numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform better than the competing alternatives.},

  abstract = {Cellular omics such as single-cell genomics, proteomics, and microbiomics allow the characterization of tissue and microbial community composition, which can be compared between conditions to identify biological drivers. This strategy has been critical to revealing markers of disease progression, such as cancer and pathogen infection. A dedicated statistical method for differential variability analysis is lacking for cellular omics data, and existing methods for differential composition analysis do not model some compositional data properties, suggesting there is room to improve model performance. Here, we introduce sccomp, a method for differential composition and variability analyses that jointly models data count distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability, and proportion mean–variability association, being aware of outliers. sccomp provides a comprehensive analysis framework that offers realistic data simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. Here, we demonstrate that mean–variability association is ubiquitous across technologies, highlighting the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We show that sccomp accurately fits experimental data, significantly improving performance over state-of-the-art algorithms. Using sccomp, we identified differential constraints and composition in the microenvironment of primary breast cancer.},

Univariable meta-regression indicated efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis varied according to 3 characteristics. Protection appeared greatest in children stringently tuberculin tested, to try to exclude prior infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or sensitization to environmental mycobacteria (rate ratio [RR], 0.26; 95\% confidence interval [CI], .18–.37), or infants (RR, 0.41; 95\% CI, .29–.58). Protection was weaker in children not stringently tested (RR, 0.59; 95\% CI, .35–1.01) and older individuals stringently or not stringently tested (RR, 0.88; 95\% CI, .59–1.31 and RR, 0.81; 95\% CI, .55–1.22, respectively). Protection was higher in trials further from the equator where environmental mycobacteria are less and with lower risk of diagnostic detection bias. These associations were attenuated in a multivariable model, but each had an independent effect. There was no evidence that efficacy was associated with BCG strain. Protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis was also high in infants (RR, 0.1; 95\% CI, .01–.77) and children stringently tuberculin tested (RR, 0.08; 95\% CI, .03–.25).Conclusions.{$\quad$}Absence of prior M. tuberculosis infection or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria is associated with higher efficacy of BCG against pulmonary tuberculosis and possibly against miliary and meningeal tuberculosis. Evaluations of new tuberculosis vaccines should account for the possibility that prior infection may mask or block their effects.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Improved identification of bacterial and viral infections would reduce morbidity from sepsis, reduce antibiotic overuse, and lower healthcare costs. Here, we develop a generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for acute bacterial and viral infections. We use training data (               N               \,=\,1069) from 18 retrospective transcriptomic studies. Using only 29 preselected host mRNAs, we train a neural-network classifier with a bacterial-vs-other area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.92 (95\% CI 0.90–0.93) and a viral-vs-other AUROC 0.92 (95\% CI 0.90–0.93). We then apply this classifier, inflammatix-bacterial-viral-noninfected-version 1~(IMX-BVN-1), without retraining, to an independent cohort (               N               \,=\,163). In this cohort, IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.86 (95\% CI 0.77–0.93), and viral-vs.-other 0.85 (95\% CI 0.76–0.93). In patients enrolled within 36\,h of hospital admission (               N               \,=\,70), IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.92 (95\% CI 0.83–0.99), and viral-vs.-other 0.91 (95\% CI 0.82–0.98). With further study, IMX-BVN-1 could provide a tool for assessing patients with suspected infection and sepsis at hospital admission.},

  abstract = {Mounting failures of replication in social and biological sciences give a new urgency to critically appraising proposed reforms. This book pulls back the cover on disagreements between experts charged with restoring integrity to science. It denies two pervasive views of the role of probability in inference: to assign degrees of belief, and to control error rates in a long run. If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive. Philosophical tools are put to work to solve problems about science and pseudoscience, induction and falsification.},

  abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

  abstract = {Background: Control of the tuberculosis epidemic requires a novel vaccine that is effective in preventing tuberculosis in adolescents, a key target population for vaccination against TB. Methods: Healthy adolescents, stratified by M. tuberculosis-infection status, were enrolled into this observer-blinded phase II clinical trial of the protein-subunit vaccine candidate, H1:IC31, comprising a fusion protein (H1) of Ag85B and ESAT-6, formulated with the IC31 adjuvant. Local and systemic adverse events and induced T cell responses were measured after one or two administrations of either 15 lg or 50 lg of the H1 protein. Results: Two hundred and forty participants were recruited and followed up for 224 days. No notable safety events were observed regardless of H1 dose or vaccination schedule. H1:IC31 vaccination induced antigen-specific CD4 T cells, co-expressing IFN-c, TNF-a and/or IL-2. H1:IC31 vaccination of M.tb-uninfected individuals preferentially drove the emergence of Ag85B and ESAT-6 specific TNF-a+IL-2+CD4 T cells, while H1:IC31 vaccination of M.tb-infected individuals resulted in the expansion of Ag85B-specific but not ESAT-6–specific TNF-a+IL-2+CD4 T cells. Conclusions: H1:IC31 was safe and immunogenic in uninfected and M.tb-infected adolescents. Two administrations of the 15 lg H1:IC31 dose induced the greatest magnitude immune response, and was considered optimal (South African National Clinical Trials Register, DoH-27-0612-3947; Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201403000464306).},

In the first step of the procedure, a global test is performed for the null hypothesis that the expected means of all treatment groups under study are equal. If this global null hypothesis can be rejected at the pre-specified level of significance, then in the second step of the procedure, one is permitted in principle to perform all pairwise comparisons at the same level of significance (although in practice, not all of them may be of primary interest). Fisher's LSD procedure is known to preserve the experimentwise type I error rate at the nominal level of significance, if (and only if) the number of treatment groups is three.

The power properties of this approach are examined in the present paper. It is shown that the power of the first step global test – and therefore the power of the overall procedure – may be relevantly lower than the power of the pairwise comparison between the more-favourable active dose group and placebo. Achieving a certain overall power for this comparison with Fisher's LSD procedure – irrespective of the effect size at the less-favourable dose group – may require slightly larger treatment groups than sizing the study with respect to the simple Bonferroni alpha adjustment. Therefore if Fisher's LSD procedure is used to avoid an alpha adjustment for phase III clinical trials, the potential loss of power due to the first-step global test should be considered at the planning stage.

  abstract = {The Lasso is an attractive regularisation method for high-dimensional regression. It combines variable selection with an efficient computational procedure. However, the rate of convergence of the Lasso is slow for some sparse high-dimensional data, where the number of predictor variables is growing fast with the number of observations. Moreover, many noise variables are selected if the estimator is chosen by cross-validation. It is shown that the contradicting demands of an efficient computational procedure and fast convergence rates of the 2-loss can be overcome by a two-stage procedure, termed the relaxed Lasso. For orthogonal designs, the relaxed Lasso provides a continuum of solutions that include both soft- and hard-thresholding of estimators. The relaxed Lasso solutions include all regular Lasso solutions and computation of all relaxed Lasso solutions is often identically expensive as computing all regular Lasso solutions. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the relaxed Lasso produces sparser models with equal or lower prediction loss than the regular Lasso estimator for high-dimensional data.},

We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

Operações de machine learning (MLOps) incorporam princípios de automação ao desenvolvimento de modelos, promovendo entrega, monitoramento e treinamento contínuos. Devido a vários fatores, como a necessidade de otimizações derivadas de mudanças nas necessidades de negócios, espera-se que os cientistas de dados criem vários experimentos para desenvolver um modelo ou preditor que atenda satisfatoriamente aos principais desafios de um dado problema. A execução de cada experimento gera metadados, como configurações de ambiente, versões de código-fonte e dados, métricas e configurações de hiperparâmetros. Esses metadados são conhecidos como artefatos ou ativos de ML. O rastreamento e o gerenciamento dessas informações são necessários para alcançar a rastreabilidade do processo de geração dos modelos, facilitando a recriação do ambiente em que determinada versão de um modelo foi originada. Vincular informações de experimentos, modelos, conjuntos de dados, configurações e alterações de código requer organização, rastreamento, manutenção e controle de versão adequados. Este trabalho investigou as melhores práticas, problemas atuais e desafios relacionados ao gerenciamento e controle de versão de artefatos. Usando ferramentas existentes, desenvolvemos um estudo de caso que permitiu o desenvolvimento e operacionalização de um fluxo de trabalho de ML com foco na gestão dos artefatos gerados, aplicando princípios de MLOps para facilitar o rastreamento e a reprodutibilidade do modelo. A abordagem baseada em estudo de caso contribuiu para coletar conhecimento empírico sobre ferramentas com foco em gerenciamento de versões, o que nos permitiu criar tutoriais sobre casos de uso comuns. Cenários cobrindo preparação de dados, geração de modelo, comparação entre versões de modelo, implantação, monitoramento, depuração e retreinamento demonstraram que o estudo de caso não apresentou problemas na recriação do ambiente de desenvolvimento de uma determinada versão de modelo. Por fim, este trabalho fornece orientação para quem deseja automatizar e operar fluxos de trabalho de ML com controle de versão de artefatos como requisito central.},

Eight signatures were measured by microfluidic RT-qPCR and participants were microbiologically-investigated for pulmonary TB at baseline, and actively surveilled for incident disease through 15 months. Diagnostic AUCs for 61 HIV-uninfected (weighted-prevalence 1.1\%) and 10 HIV-infected (prevalence 1.2\%) prevalent TB cases for the 8 signatures were 0.63–0.79 and 0.65–0.88, respectively. Thereafter, 24 HIV-uninfected and 9 HIV-infected participants progressed to incident TB (1.1 and 1.0 per 100 person-years, respectively). Prognostic AUCs through 15-months follow-up were 0.49–0.66 and 0.54–0.81, respectively. Prognostic performance for incident TB occurring within 6-12 months in HIV-negative participants was higher for all signatures.

  abstract = {Behavioural responses to novelty, including fear and subsequent avoidance of novel stimuli, behaviours referred to as neophobia, determine how animals interact with their environment. Neophobia aids in navigating risk and impacts on adaptability and survival. There is variation within and between individuals and species, however, lack of large-scale, comparative studies critically limits investigation of the socio-ecological drivers of neophobia. In this study, we tested responses to novel objects and food (alongside familiar food) versus a baseline (familiar food alone) in 10 corvid species (241 subjects) across 10 labs worldwide. There were species differences in the latency to touch familiar food in the novel object and food conditions relative to the baseline. Three of seven socio-ecological factors influenced object neophobia: 1) use of urban habitat (vs not), 2) territorial pair vs family group sociality and 3) large vs small flock size (whereas range, caching, hunting live animals, and genus did not); while only flock size influenced food neophobia. We found that, overall, individuals were temporally and contextually repeatable (i.e. consistent) in their novelty responses in all conditions, indicating neophobia is a stable behavioural trait. With this study, we have established a network of corvid researchers, demonstrating potential for further collaboration to explore the evolution of cognition in corvids and other bird species. These novel findings enable us, for the first time in corvids, to identify the socio-ecological correlates of neophobia and grant insight into specific elements that drive higher neophobic responses in this avian family group.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {The fast-paced development of computational tools has enabled tremendous scientific progress in recent years. However, this rapid surge of technological capability also comes at a cost, as it leads to an increase in the complexity of software environments and potential compatibility issues across systems. Advanced workflows in processing or analysis often require specific software versions and operating systems to run smoothly, and discrepancies across machines and researchers can impede reproducibility and efficient collaboration. As a result, scientific teams are increasingly relying on containers to implement robust, dependable research ecosystems. Originally popularized in software engineering, containers have become common in scientific projects, particularly in large collaborative efforts. In this Primer, we describe what containers are, how they work and the rationale for their use in scientific projects. We review state-of-the-art implementations in diverse contexts and fields, with examples in various scientific fields. Finally, we discuss the possibilities enabled by the widespread adoption of containerization, especially in the context of open and reproducible research, and propose recommendations to facilitate seamless implementation across platforms and domains, including within high-performance computing clusters such as those typically available at universities and research institutes.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is a significant health problem without an effective vaccine to combat it. A thorough understanding of the immune response and correlates of protection is needed to develop a more efficient vaccine. The immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is complex and involves all aspects of the immune system, however, the optimal protective, non-­pathogenic T cell response against Mtb is still elusive. This review will focus on discussing CD4 T cell immunity against mycobacteria and its importance in Mtb infection with a primary focus on human studies. We will in particular discuss the large heterogeneity of immune cell subsets that have been revealed by recent immunological investigations at an unprecedented level of detail. These studies have identified specific classical CD4 T cell subsets important for immune responses against Mtb in various states of infection. We further discuss the functional attributes that have been linked to the various subsets such as upregulation of activation markers and cytokine production. Another important topic to be considered is the antigenic targets of Mtb-­specific immune responses, and how antigen reactivity is influenced by both disease state and environmental exposure(s). These are key points for both vaccines and immune diagnostics development. Ultimately, these factors are holistically considered in the definition and investigations of what are the correlates on protection and resolution of disease.},

  abstract = {An estimated one-third of tuberculosis (TB) cases go undiagnosed or unreported. Sputum samples, widely used for TB diagnosis, are inefficient at detecting infection in children and paucibacillary patients. Indeed, developing point-of-care biomarker-based diagnostics that are not sputum-based is a major priority for the WHO. Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we tested whether pulmonary TB can be detected by analyzing patient exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. We find that the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific lipids, lipoarabinomannan lipoglycan, and proteins in EBCs can efficiently differentiate baseline TB patients from controls. We used EBCs to track the longitudinal effects of antibiotic treatment in pediatric TB patients. In addition, Mtb lipoarabinomannan and lipids were structurally distinct in EBCs compared to ex vivo cultured bacteria, revealing specific metabolic and biochemical states of Mtb in the human lung. This provides essential information for the rational development or improvement of diagnostic antibodies, vaccines and therapeutic drugs. Our data collectively indicate that EBC analysis can potentially facilitate clinical diagnosis of TB across patient populations and monitor treatment efficacy. This affordable, rapid and non-invasive approach seems superior to sputum assays and has the potential to be implemented at point-of-care.},

Tuberculosis risk is significantly higher after recent compared to remote TBI. We aimed to define a blood-based biomarker, measured with a simple flow cytometry assay, to stratify different stages of TBI to infer risk of disease.                                                Methods                            Healthy adolescents were serially tested with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) to define recent (QFT conversion {$<$}6 months) and remote (persistent QFT+ for {$>$}1 year) TBI. M.tb-specific T cells were defined as IFN-g+TNF+CD3+ cells upon CFP-10/ESAT-6 or M.tb lysate stimulation. ΔHLA-DR median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was defined as the difference in HLA-DR expression between M.tb-specific and total T cells. Biomarker performance was assessed by blinded prediction in untouched test cohorts with recent               versus               remote TBI or tuberculosis disease, and unblinded analysis of asymptomatic adolescents with TBI who remained healthy (non-progressors) or who progressed to microbiologically-confirmed disease (progressors).                                                Findings             In the test cohorts, frequencies of M.tb-specific T cells differentiated between QFT- (n=25) and QFT+ (n=47) individuals [area under the ROC curve (AUCROC): 0.94; 95\%CI: 0.87-1.00]. ΔHLA-DR MFI significantly discriminated between recent (n=20) and remote (n=22) TBI (AUCROC 0.91; 95\%CI: 0.83-1.00); remote TBI and newly diagnosed tuberculosis (n=19; AUCROC 0.99; 95\%CI: 0.96-1.00); and between tuberculosis progressors (n=22) and non-progressors (n=34; AUCROC 0.75, 95\%CI: 0.63-0.87).                                   Interpretation             The ΔHLA-DR MFI biomarker can identify individuals with recent TBI and those with disease progression, allowing targeted provision of TPT to those at highest risk of tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {An efficacious tuberculosis (TB) vaccine is critical to reducing the global burden of TB. TB vaccine trials require the identification of multiple sites globally that have both a high incidence of TB and the capacity to conduct a clinical trial. To expand the diversity of potential phase III TB vaccine trial sites to be considered for inclusion, we describe a novel epidemiologic method that incorporates approaches from a variety of public health practices. Our approach incorporates analytic methodology to enable quantification and validation of qualitative information from disparate data sources, and epidemiologic analysis to systematically assess site-specific TB epidemiology. The integration of robust data-driven practices, and more quantitatively focused analysis, allowed for the objective evaluation of sites, which resulted in the identification of sites and catchment areas with high TB burden that may not have been previously considered. This suggests that an integrated epidemiologic methodology, not traditionally utilized for clinical trial site evaluations, could be integrated into site feasibility assessments as it results in more rapid site identification and reduces unintended bias.},

We consider an adaptive containerization approach, with a focus on accelerating the deployment of applications and workflows on HPC systems using containers. To this end, we discuss the specific HPC requirements regarding container tools, and analyze the entire containerization stack, including container engines and registries, in-depth. Finally, we consider various orchestrator and HPC workload manager integration scenarios.},

  abstract = {CD4 T cells are critical for protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the cause of tuberculosis (TB). Yet to date, TB vaccine candidates that boost antigen-specific CD4 T cells have conferred little or no protection. Here we examined CD4 T cell responses to two leading TB vaccine antigens, ESAT-6 and Ag85B, in Mtb-infected mice and in vaccinated humans with and without underlying Mtb infection. In both species, Mtb infection drove ESAT-6-specific T cells to be more differentiated than Ag85B-specific T cells. The ability of each T cell population to control Mtb in the lungs of mice was restricted for opposite reasons: Ag85Bspecific T cells were limited by reduced antigen expression during persistent infection, whereas ESAT-6-specific T cells became functionally exhausted due to chronic antigenic stimulation. Our findings suggest that different vaccination strategies will be required to optimize protection mediated by T cells recognizing antigens expressed at distinct stages of Mtb infection.},

The axes of this space can then be compared against other omics measurements to obtain biological information. Application of LAVENDER to multidimensional flow cytometry datasets of 301 Japanese individuals immunized with a seasonal influenza vaccine revealed an axis related to baseline immunological characteristics of each individual. This axis correlated with the proportion of plasma cells and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, a clinical marker of the systemic inflammatory response. The same method was also applicable to mass cytometry data with more molecular markers. These results demonstrate that LAVENDER is a useful tool for identifying critical heterogeneity among similar, yet different, single-cell datasets.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility in Data Analysis research has long been a significant concern, particularly in the areas of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Towards the aim of developing reproducible and reusable processes, Data Analysis management tools can help giving structure and coherence to complex data flows. Nonetheless, improved software quality comes at the cost of additional design and planning effort, which may become impractical in rapidly changing development environments. I propose that an adjustment of focus from processes to data in the management of Bioinformatic pipelines may help improving reproducibility with minimal impact on preexisting development practices. In this paper I introduce the repoR package for bioinformatic analysis management. The tool supports a data-centered philosophy that aims at improving analysis reproducibility and reusability with minimal design overhead. The core of repo lies in its support for easy data storage, retrieval, distribution and annotation. In repo the data analysis flow is derived a posteriori from dependency annotations. The repo package constitutes an unobtrusive data and flow management extension of the R statistical language. Its adoption, together with good development practices, can help improving data analysis management, sharing and reproducibility, especially in the fields of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection confers a predisposition to the development of tuberculosis disease, the leading killer among global infectious diseases. H4:IC31, a candidate subunit vaccine, has shown protection against tuberculosis disease in preclinical models, and observational studies have indicated that primary bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination may offer partial protection against infection. METHODS In this phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 990 adolescents in a high-risk setting who had undergone neonatal BCG vaccination to receive the H4:IC31 vaccine, BCG revaccination, or placebo. All the participants had negative results on testing for M. tuberculosis infection on the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT) and for the human immunodeficiency virus. The primary outcomes were safety and acquisition of M. tuberculosis infection, as defined by initial conversion on QFT that was performed every 6 months during a 2-year period. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity and sustained QFT conversion to a positive test without reversion to negative status at 3 months and 6 months after conversion. Estimates of vaccine efficacy are based on hazard ratios from Cox regression models and compare each vaccine with placebo. RESULTS Both the BCG and H4:IC31 vaccines were immunogenic. QFT conversion occurred in 44 of 308 participants (14.3\%) in the H4:IC31 group and in 41 of 312 participants (13.1\%) in the BCG group, as compared with 49 of 310 participants (15.8\%) in the placebo group; the rate of sustained conversion was 8.1\% in the H4:IC31 group and 6.7\% in the BCG group, as compared with 11.6\% in the placebo group. Neither the H4:IC31 vaccine nor the BCG vaccine prevented initial QFT conversion, with efficacy point estimates of 9.4\% (P\,=\,0.63) and 20.1\% (P\,=\,0.29), respectively. However, the BCG vaccine reduced the rate of sustained QFT conversion, with an efficacy of 45.4\% (P\,=\,0.03); the efficacy of the H4:IC31 vaccine was 30.5\% (P\,=\,0.16). There were no clinically significant betweengroup differences in the rates of serious adverse events, although mild-to-moderate injection-site reactions were more common with BCG revaccination. CONCLUSIONS In this trial, the rate of sustained QFT conversion, which may reflect sustained M. tuberculosis infection, was reduced by vaccination in a high-transmission setting. This finding may inform clinical development of new vaccine candidates. (Funded by Aeras and others; C-040-404 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02075203.)},

  abstract = {The Executable Research Compendium (ERC) is a concept for packaging data, code, text, and user interface configurations in a single package to increase transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of computational research. This article introduces the ERC reproducibility service (ERS) for a publication workflow enhanced by ERCs. The ERS connects with existing scientific infrastructures and was deployed and tested with a focus on data and visualisation methods for open geospatial sciences. We describe the architecture of a reference implementation for the reproducibility service, including the created Web API. We critically discuss both the project set-up and features of ERC and ERS, and examine them in the light of various classifications for reproducible research. The ERC and ERS are found to be a powerful tool to improve reproducibility and thereby enable better investigating and understanding of computational workflows during peer review. We derive lessons learned and challenges for future scholarly publishing of computer-based geospatial research.},

  abstract = {Critical goals of scientific computing are to increase scientific rigor, reproducibility, and transparency while keeping up with ever-increasing computational demands. This work presents an integrated framework well-suited for data processing and analysis spanning individual, on-premises, and cloud environments. This framework leverages three well-established DevOps tools: 1) Git repositories linked to 2) CI/CD engines operating on 3) containers. It supports the full life-cycle of scientific data workflows with minimal friction between stages--including solutions for researchers who generate data. This is achieved by leveraging a single container that supports local, interactive user sessions and deployment in HPC or Kubernetes clusters. Combined with Git repositories integrated with CI/CD, this approach enables decentralized data pipelines across multiple, arbitrary computational environments. This framework has been successfully deployed and validated within our research group, spanning experimental acquisition systems and computational clusters with open-source, purpose-built GitLab CI/CD executors for slurm and Google Kubernetes Engine Autopilot. Taken together, this framework can increase the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of compute-dependent scientific research.},

Multidimensional scaling methods (MDS) are techniques for dimensionality reduction, where data from a high-dimensional space are mapped into a lower-dimensional space. Such methods consume relevant computational resources; therefore, intensive research has been developed to accelerate them. In this work, two efficient parallel versions of the well-known and precise SMACOF algorithm to solve MDS problems have been developed and evaluated on multicore and GPU. To help the user of SMACOF, we provide these parallel versions and a complementary Python code based on a heuristic approach to explore the optimal configuration of the parallel SMACOF algorithm on the available platforms in terms of energy efficiency (GFLOPs/watt). Three platforms, 64 and 12 CPU-cores and a GPU device, have been considered for the experimental evaluation.},

While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modeling, which is often one of the most interesting topics to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we motivate, guide, and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.},

  abstract = {We present a novel storage manager for multi-dimensional arrays that arise in scientific applications, which is part of a larger scientific data management system called TileDB. In contrast to existing solutions, TileDB is optimized for both dense and sparse arrays. Its key idea is to organize array elements into ordered collections called fragments. Each fragment is dense or sparse, and groups contiguous array elements into data tiles of fixed capacity. The organization into fragments turns random writes into sequential writes, and, coupled with a novel read algorithm, leads to very efficient reads. TileDB enables parallelization via multi-threading and multiprocessing, offering thread-/process-safety and atomicity via lightweight locking. We show that TileDB delivers comparable performance to the HDF5 dense array storage manager, while providing much faster random writes. We also show that TileDB offers substantially faster reads and writes than the SciDB array database system with both dense and sparse arrays. Finally, we demonstrate that TileDB is considerably faster than adaptations of the Vertica relational column-store for dense array storage management, and at least as fast for the case of sparse arrays.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, a parabola is a plane curve which is mirror-symmetrical and is approximately U-shaped. It fits several superficially different mathematical descriptions, which can all be proved to define exactly the same curves. One description of a parabola involves a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix). The focus does not lie on the directrix. The parabola is the locus of points in that plane that are equidistant from both the directrix and the focus. Another description of a parabola is as a conic section, created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane parallel to another plane that is tangential to the conical surface.The line perpendicular to the directrix and passing through the focus (that is, the line that splits the parabola through the middle) is called the "axis of symmetry". The point where the parabola intersects its axis of symmetry is called the "vertex" and is the point where the parabola is most sharply curved. The distance between the vertex and the focus, measured along the axis of symmetry, is the "focal length". The "latus rectum" is the chord of the parabola that is parallel to the directrix and passes through the focus. Parabolas can open up, down, left, right, or in some other arbitrary direction. Any parabola can be repositioned and rescaled to fit exactly on any other parabola—that is, all parabolas are geometrically similar. Parabolas have the property that, if they are made of material that reflects light, then light that travels parallel to the axis of symmetry of a parabola and strikes its concave side is reflected to its focus, regardless of where on the parabola the reflection occurs. Conversely, light that originates from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel ("collimated") beam, leaving the parabola parallel to the axis of symmetry. The same effects occur with sound and other waves. This reflective property is the basis of many practical uses of parabolas. The parabola has many important applications, from a parabolic antenna or parabolic microphone to automobile headlight reflectors and the design of ballistic missiles. It is frequently used in physics, engineering, and many other areas.},

  abstract = {Manual analysis of flow cytometry data and subjective gate-border decisions taken by individuals continue to be a source of variation in the assessment of antigen-specific T cells when comparing data across laboratories, and also over time in individual labs. Therefore, strategies to provide automated analysis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimer-binding T cells represent an attractive solution to decrease subjectivity and technical variation. The challenge of using an automated analysis approach is that MHC multimer-binding T cell populations are often rare and therefore difficult to detect. We used a highly heterogeneous dataset from a recent MHC multimer proficiency panel to assess if MHC multimer-binding CD8+ T cells could be analyzed with computational solutions currently available, and if such analyses would reduce the technical variation across different laboratories. We used three different methods, FLOw Clustering without K (FLOCK), Scalable Weighted Iterative Flow-clustering Technique (SWIFT), and ReFlow to analyze flow cytometry data files from 28 laboratories. Each laboratory screened for antigen-responsive T cell populations with frequency ranging from 0.01 to 1.5\% of lymphocytes within samples from two donors. Experience from this analysis shows that all three programs can be used for the identification of high to intermediate frequency of MHC multimer-binding T cell populations, with results very similar to that of manual gating. For the less frequent populations ({$<$}0.1\% of live, single lymphocytes), SWIFT outperformed the other tools. As used in this study, none of the algorithms offered a completely automated pipeline for identification of MHC multimer populations, as varying degrees of human interventions were needed to complete the analysis. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using automated analysis pipelines for assessing and identifying even rare populations of antigen-responsive T cells and discuss the main properties, differences, and advantages of the different methods tested.},

  abstract = {Combining single-cell cytometry datasets increases the analytical flexibility and the statistical power of data analyses. However, in many cases the full potential of co-analyses is not reached due to technical variance between data from different experimental batches. Here, we present cyCombine, a method to robustly integrate cytometry data from different batches, experiments, or even different experimental techniques, such as CITE-seq, flow cytometry, and mass cytometry. We demonstrate that cyCombine maintains the biological variance and the structure of the data, while minimizing the technical variance between datasets. cyCombine does not require technical replicates across datasets, and computation time scales linearly with the number of cells, allowing for integration of massive datasets. Robust, accurate, and scalable integration of cytometry data enables integration of multiple datasets for primary data analyses and the validation of results using public datasets.},

  abstract = {In this tutorial, we describe a workflow to ensure long-term reproducibility of R-based data analyses. The workflow leverages established tools and practices from software engineering. It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles, and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 2) the analysis exactly reproduces at a later point in time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Combining containerization, dependence management, version management, and dynamic document generation, the proposed workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.},

It is widely used in computer science, bioscience, geoscience, and economics. Although the state-of-the-art partition-based and connectivity-based clustering methods have been developed, weak connectivity and heterogeneous density in data impede their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a boundary-seeking Clustering algorithm using the local Direction Centrality (CDC). It adopts a density-independent metric based on the distribution of K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) to distinguish between internal and boundary points. The boundary points generate enclosed cages to bind the connections of internal points, thereby preventing cross-cluster connections and separating weakly-connected clusters. We demonstrate the validity of CDC by detecting complex structured clusters in challenging synthetic datasets, identifying cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data, recognizing speakers on voice corpuses, and testifying on various types of real-world benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing technology have spurred two extraordinary phenomena in science: large-scale and high-throughput data collection coupled with the creation and implementation of complex statistical algorithms for data analysis. These two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproducibility in public health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns about the replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.},

  abstract = {Background Vaccination that prevents tuberculosis (TB) disease, particularly in adolescents, would have the greatest impact on the global TB epidemic. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate M72/AS01E was evaluated in healthy, HIV-negative adolescents in a TB endemic region, regardless of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection status. Methods In a phase II, double-blind randomized, controlled study (NCT00950612), two doses of M72/AS01E or placebo were administered intramuscularly, one month apart. Participants were followed-up post-vaccination, for 6 months. M72-specific immunogenicity was evaluated by intracellular cytokine staining analysis of T cells and NK cells by flow cytometry. Results No serious adverse events were recorded. M72/AS01E induced robust T cell and antibody responses, including antigen-dependent NK cell IFN-γ production. CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were sustained at 6 months post vaccination. Irrespective of M.tb infection status, vaccination induced a high frequency of M72-specific CD4 T cells expressing multiple combinations of Th1 cytokines, and low level IL-17. We observed rapid boosting of immune responses in M.tb-infected participants, suggesting natural infection acts as a prime to vaccination. Conclusions The clinically acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile of M72/AS01E in adolescents living in an area with high TB burden support the move to efficacy trials.},

  abstract = {Improved tuberculosis diagnostics and tools for monitoring treatment response are urgently needed. We developed a robust and simple, PCR-based host-blood transcriptomic signature, RISK6, for multiple applications: identifying individuals at risk of incident disease, as a screening test for subclinical or clinical tuberculosis, and for monitoring tuberculosis treatment. RISK6 utility was validated by blind prediction using quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in seven independent cohorts. Prognostic performance significantly exceeded that of previous signatures discovered in the same cohort. Performance for diagnosing subclinical and clinical disease in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons, assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, exceeded 85\%. As a screening test for tuberculosis, the sensitivity at 90\% specificity met or approached the benchmarks set out in World Health Organization target product profiles for non-sputum-based tests. RISK6 scores correlated with lung immunopathology activity, measured by positron emission tomography, and tracked treatment response, demonstrating utility as treatment response biomarker, while predicting treatment failure prior to treatment initiation. Performance of the test in capillary blood samples collected by finger-prick was noninferior to venous blood collected in PAXgene tubes. These results support incorporation of RISK6 into rapid, capillary blood-based point-of-care PCR devices for prospective assessment in field studies.},

  abstract = {Background Funding agencies and research journals are increasingly demanding that researchers share their data in public repositories. Despite these requirements, researchers still withhold data, refuse to share, and deposit data that lacks annotation. We conducted a meta-synthesis to examine the views, perspectives, and experiences of academic researchers on data sharing and reuse of research data. Methods We searched the published and unpublished literature for studies on data sharing by researchers in academic institutions. Two independent reviewers screened citations and abstracts, then full-text articles. Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators. The abstracted data was read and reread in order to generate codes. Key concepts were identified and thematic analysis was used for data synthesis. Results We reviewed 2005 records and included 45 studies along with 3 companion reports. The studies were published between 2003 and 2018 and most were conducted in North America (60\%) or Europe (17\%). The four major themes that emerged were data integrity, responsible conduct of research, feasibility of sharing data, and value of sharing data. Researchers lack time, resources, and skills to effectively share their data in public repositories. Data quality is affected by this, along with subjective decisions around what is considered to be worth sharing. Deficits in infrastructure also impede the availability of research data. Incentives for sharing data are lacking. Conclusion Researchers lack skills to share data in a manner that is efficient and effective. Improved infrastructure support would allow them to make data available quickly and seamlessly. The lack of incentives for sharing research data with regards to academic appointment, promotion, recognition, and rewards need to be addressed.},

We identify clusters of pro-inflammatory AMs associated with stressed bacteria, in addition to three different populations of IMs with heterogeneous bacterial phenotypes. Finally, we show that the main macrophage populations in the lung are epigenetically constrained in their response to infection, while inter-species comparison reveals that most AMs subsets are conserved between mice and humans. This conceptual approach is readily transferable to other infectious disease agents with the potential for an increased understanding of the roles that different host cell populations play during the course of an infection.},

Our investigations were run on up-to-date hardware and the latest available software as of early 2023. To get a more detailed picture, we examined three different system aspects: we ran separate benchmarks on CPU, memory, and I/O intensive operations. These aspects were tested with microbenchmarks, and at a high level – an HPC workload pipeline which intensely loaded each aspect. As a result of our investigations we show that Singularity containerization continues to provide as good, or in some cases even better performance indicators as in a native environment – with the substantial added benefits of application flexibility and portability.},

A broad array of stakeholders from the HIV prevention research community reviewed current trial designs and lessons learned, explored issues specific to unique product classes, and concluded with specialist-focused examinations of statistical design concepts and the importance of community engagement in research. The aim was to reflect on current approaches and evaluate new trial design approaches for evaluating efficacy of a candidate prevention strategy in the context of an active-controlled trial, which does not include a placebo arm. In this report, we provide a summary of the discussion points that included gaps in understanding and logical next steps in the prevention research pathway. The technical challenges involved in the statistical design approaches are described in a companion article.},

We represent shape constrained model components by mildly non-linear extensions of P-splines. Models can contain multiple shape constrained and unconstrained terms as well as shape constrained multi-dimensional smooths. The constraints considered are on the sign of the first or/and the second derivatives of the smooth terms. A key advantage of the approach is that it facilitates efficient estimation of smoothing parameters as an integral part of model estimation, via GCV or AIC, and numerically robust algorithms for this are presented. We also derive simulation free approximate Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth components, which are shown to achieve close to nominal coverage probabilities. Applications are presented using real data examples including the risk of disease in relation to proximity to municipal incinerators and the association between air pollution and health.},

  abstract = {In biomedical applications, an experimenter encounters different potential sources of variation in data such as individual samples, multiple experimental conditions, and multivariate responses of a panel of markers such as from a signaling network. In multiparametric cytometry, which is often used for analyzing patient samples, such issues are critical. While computational methods can identify cell populations in individual samples, without the ability to automatically match them across samples, it is difficult to compare and characterize the populations in typical experiments, such as those responding to various stimulations or distinctive of particular patients or time-points, especially when there are many samples. Joint Clustering and Matching (JCM) is a multi-level framework for simultaneous modeling and registration of populations across a cohort. JCM models every population with a robust multivariate probability distribution. Simultaneously, JCM fits a random-effects model to construct an overall batch template – used for registering populations across samples, and classifying new samples. By tackling systems-level variation, JCM supports practical biomedical applications involving large cohorts. Software for fitting the JCM models have been implemented in an R package EMMIX-JCM, available from http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/\textasciitilde gjm/mix\_soft/EMMIX-JCM/.},

A factor often called into question for ORD low usage is the quality of the ORD and associated metadata. This work aims to illustrate the use of ORD, published by the Figshare scientific repository, concerning their scientific discipline, their type and compared with the quality of their metadata. Considering all the Figshare resources and carrying out a programmatic quality assessment of their metadata, our analysis highlighted two aspects. First, irrespective of the scientific domain considered, most ORD are under-used, but with exceptional cases which concentrate most researchers’ attention. Second, there was no evidence that the use of ORD is associated with good metadata publishing practices. These two findings opened to a reflection about the potential causes of such data friction.},

While many will espouse reproducibility as a value, the challenge of making it happen (both for themselves and testing the reproducibility of others' work) often outweigh the benefits. There have been a few reproducibility solutions designed and implemented by the community. In particular, the authors are contributors to ReproZip, a tool to enable computational reproducibility by tracing and bundling together research in the environment in which it takes place (e.g. one's computer or server). In this white paper, we introduce a tool for unpacking ReproZip bundles in the cloud, ReproServer. ReproServer takes an uploaded ReproZip bundle (.rpz file) or a link to a ReproZip bundle, and users can then unpack them in the cloud via their browser, allowing them to reproduce colleagues' work without having to install anything locally. This will help lower the barrier to reproducing others' work, which will aid reviewers in verifying the claims made in papers and reusing previously published research.},

Each variation type requires a different correction strategy, and their unknown contributions to overall variability hinder automated correction. We now describe swiftReg, an automated method that reduces undesired sources of variability between samples and particularly between batches. A high-resolution cluster map representing the multidimensional data is generated using the SWIFT algorithm, and shifts in cluster positions between samples are measured. Subpopulations are aligned between samples by displacing cell parameter values according to registration vectors derived from independent or locally-averaged cluster shifts. Batch variation is addressed by registering batch control or consensus samples, and applying the resulting shifts to individual samples. swiftReg selectively reduces batch variation, enhancing detection of biological differences. swiftReg outputs registered datasets as standard~.FCS files to facilitate further analysis by other tools.},

Thus, one of the major current developments exists in exploring the potential of gamification to engage people in cooperative activity. However, while the literature on this phenomenon is growing in numbers, it remains unclear how gamification motivates cooperation and how effective it is in cooperative settings. This lack of understanding obstructs us from designing gamification that appropriately supports cooperation and from comprehending what potential hurdles need to be considered. We close this gap by theorizing a framework for gamifying cooperation. Guided by this framework, we systematically review and synthesize the existing literature (n~=~51) to understand how gamification has been previously employed to motivate cooperation and what is known about the effects of gamification in cooperative contexts. The main contribution of the present study consists in deducing three different approaches (i.e., based on individualistic, cooperative, and hybrid use of features) to motivate cooperation by gamification and in providing a strategic platform for future research by proposing 11 agenda points regarding thematic, theoretical, and methodological future research avenues for gamifying cooperative activity.},

  abstract = {The accurate identification of rare antigen-specific cytokine positive cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after antigenic stimulation in an intracellular staining (ICS) flow cytometry assay is challenging, as cytokine positive events may be fairly diffusely distributed and lack an obvious separation from the negative population. Traditionally, the approach by flow operators has been to manually set a positivity threshold to partition events into cytokine-positive and cytokine-negative. This approach suffers from subjectivity and inconsistency across different flow operators. The use of statistical clustering methods does not remove the need to find an objective threshold between between positive and negative events since consistent identification of rare event subsets is highly challenging for automated algorithms, especially when there is distributional overlap between the positive and negative events (“smear”). We present a new approach, based on the Fβ measure, that is similar to manual thresholding in providing a hard cutoff, but has the advantage of being determined objectively. The performance of this algorithm is compared with results obtained by expert visual gating. Several ICS data sets from the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) proficiency program were used to make the comparisons. We first show that visually determined thresholds are difficult to reproduce and pose a problem when comparing results across operators or laboratories, as well as problems that occur with the use of commonly employed clustering algorithms. In contrast, a single parameterization for the Fβ method performs consistently across different centers, samples, and instruments because it optimizes the precision/recall tradeoff by using both negative and positive controls.},

  abstract = {Several immune-based assays have been suggested to differentiate latent from active tuberculosis (TB). However, their relative performance as well as their efficacy in HIVinfected persons, a highly at-risk population, remains unclear. In a study of 81 individuals, divided into four groups based on their HIV-1 status and TB disease activity, we compared the differentiation (CD27 and KLRG1), activation (HLA-DR), homing potential (CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, and CD161) and functional profiles (IFNγ, IL-2, and TNFα) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific CD4+ T cells using flow cytometry. Active TB disease induced major changes within the Mtb-responding CD4+ T cell population, promoting memory maturation, elevated activation and increased inflammatory potential when compared to individuals with latent TB infection. Moreover, the functional profile of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells appeared to be inherently related to their degree of differentiation. While these specific cell features were all capable of discriminating latent from active TB, irrespective of HIV status, HLA-DR expression showed the best performance for TB diagnosis [area-under-the-curve (AUC) = 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.82–1.01, specificity: 82\%, sensitivity: 84\% for HIV− and AUC = 0.99, 95\% CI: 0.98–1.01, specificity: 94\%, sensitivity: 93\% for HIV+]. In conclusion, these data support the idea that analysis of T cell phenotype can be diagnostically useful in TB.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.},

  abstract = {The protective effect of BCG against tuberculosis (TB) estimated in randomized controlled trials and observational studies ranges from negative to close to a 100\%. One of the many explanations offered for this is that different immunological mechanisms may be associated with protective effect against different forms and sites of disease. In this investigation, we recalculated vaccine protective effect separately for pulmonary disease and for meningeal/miliary disease in randomized controlled trials and case-control studies, tested for heterogeneity in site-specific estimates of protective effect and calculated a summary measure when appropriate. We found protective effect against pulmonary disease to be heterogeneous to a statistically significant degree, and thus we did not calculate a summary measure of protection. Protective effect against meningeal and miliary TB was higher than against pulmonary disease and, except for a single study with two cases only, appeared to be homogenous. Summary BCG protective effect against miliary or meningeal TB in randomized controlled trials was 86\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 65, 95) and in case-control studies 75\% (95\% CI: 61, 84). The fact that protective effect appeared to be homogeneous against meningitis and miliary TB but not against pulmonary disease may result from the fact that patients with meningitis are on average younger and thus less likely to have been exposed to atypical bacteria; to a waning of the protective effect of BCG; or from the diversity of mechanisms of pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, which can originate from reinfection, reactivation or primary progression.},

  abstract = {Public media and researchers in different areas have recently focused on perhaps unexpected problems that derive from an excessive and frequent use of technology, giving rise to a new kind of psychological “digital” wellbeing. Such a novel and pressing topic has fostered, both in the academia and in the industry, the emergence of a variety of digital self-control tools allowing users to self-regulate their technology use through interventions like timers and lock-out mechanisms. While these emerging technologies for behavior change hold great promise to support people’s digital wellbeing, we still have a limited understanding of their real effectiveness, as well as of how to best design and evaluate them. Aiming to guide future research in this important domain, this article presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current work on tools for digital self-control. We surface motivations, strategies, design choices, and challenges that characterize the design, development, and evaluation of digital self-control tools. Furthermore, we estimate their overall effect size on reducing (unwanted) technology use through a meta-analysis. By discussing our findings, we provide insights on how to (i) overcome a limited perspective that exclusively focuses on technology overuse and self-monitoring tools, (ii) evaluate digital self-control tools through long-term studies and standardized measures, and (iii) bring ethics in the digital wellbeing discourse and deal with the business model of contemporary tech companies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND A national survey of tuberculosis was conducted in England and Wales in 1998 to obtain detailed information on the occurrence of the disease and recent trends. This survey also piloted the methodology for enhanced tuberculosis surveillance in England and Wales and investigated the prevalence of HIV infection in adults with tuberculosis. METHODS Clinical and demographic data for all cases diagnosed during 1998 were obtained, together with microbiological data where available. Annual incidence rates in the population were estimated by age, sex, ethnic group, and geographical region using denominators from the 1998 Labour Force Survey. Incidence rates in different subgroups of the population were compared with the rates observed in previous surveys. The tuberculosis survey database for 1998 was matched against the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre HIV/AIDS database to estimate the prevalence of HIV co-infection in adult patients with tuberculosis. RESULTS A total of 5658 patients with tuberculosis were included in the survey in England and Wales (94\% of all formally notified cases during the same period), giving an annual rate of 10.93 per 100 000 population (95\% CI 10.87 to 10.99). This represented an increase of 11\% in the number of cases since the survey in 1993 and 21\% since 1988. In many regions case numbers have remained little changed since 1988, but in London an increase of 71\% was observed. The number of children with tuberculosis has decreased by 10\% since 1993. Annual rates of tuberculosis per 100 000 population have continued to decline among the white population (4.38) and those from the Indian subcontinent, although the rate for the latter has remained high at 121 per 100 000. Annual rates per 100 000 have increased in all other ethnic groups, especially among those of black African (210) and Chinese (77.3) origin. Over 50\% of all patients were born outside the UK. Recent entrants to the UK had higher rates of the disease than those who had been in the country for more than 5 years or who had been born in the UK. An estimated 3.3\% of all adults with tuberculosis were co-infected with HIV. CONCLUSIONS The epidemiology of tuberculosis continues to change in England and Wales and the annual number of cases is rising. More than one third of cases now occur in young adults and rates are particularly high in those recently arrived from high prevalence areas of the world. The geographical distribution is uneven with urban centres having the highest rates. The increase in the number of cases in London is particularly large. Tuberculosis in patients co-infected with HIV makes a small but important contribution to the overall increase, particularly in London. To be most effective and to make the most efficient use of resources, tuberculosis prevention and control measures must be based on accurate and timely information on the occurrence of disease. A new system of continuous enhanced tuberculosis surveillance was introduced in 1999, based on the methodology developed in this national survey.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches of electronic databases 1950 to November 2013, checking of reference lists, hand searching of journals, and contact with experts. Setting Community congregate settings and households. Inclusion criteria Vaccinated and unvaccinated children aged under 16 with known recent exposure to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Children were screened for infection with M tuberculosis with interferon γ release assays. Data extraction Study results relating to diagnostic accuracy were extracted and risk estimates were combined with random effects meta-analysis. Results The primary analysis included 14 studies and 3855 participants. The estimated overall risk ratio was 0.81 (95\% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.92), indicating a protective efficacy of 19\% against infection among vaccinated children after exposure compared with unvaccinated children. The observed protection was similar when estimated with the two types of interferon γ release assays (ELISpot or QuantiFERON). Restriction of the analysis to the six studies (n=1745) with information on progression to active tuberculosis at the time of screening showed protection against infection of 27\% (risk ratio 0.73, 0.61 to 0.87) compared with 71\% (0.29, 0.15 to 0.58) against active tuberculosis. Among those infected, protection against progression to disease was 58\% (0.42, 0.23 to 0.77). Conclusions BCG protects against M tuberculosis infection as well as progression from infection to disease.

Responses are measured by whole blood intracellular cytokine staining at baseline and 70 days after vaccination with H4:IC31 (subunit vaccine containing Ag85B and TB10.4), Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG, a live attenuated vaccine) or placebo (n\,=\,\textasciitilde 30 per group). H4:IC31 vaccination induces Ag85B and TB10.4-specific CD4 T cells, and an unexpected NKT               like               subset, that expresses IFN-γ, TNF and/or IL-2. BCG revaccination increases frequencies of CD4 T cell subsets that either express Th1 cytokines or IL-22, and modestly increases IFNγ-producing NK cells. In vitro BCG re-stimulation also triggers responses by donor-unrestricted T cells, which may contribute to host responses against mycobacteria. BCG, which demonstrated efficacy against sustained               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               infection, modulates multiple immune cell subsets, in particular conventional Th1 and Th22 cells, which should be investigated in discovery studies of correlates of protection.},

  abstract = {Since the appearance of Docker in 2013, container technologies for computers have evolved and gained importance in cloud data centers. However, adoption of containers in High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers is still under discussion: on one hand, the ease in portability is very well accepted; on the other hand, the performance penalties and security issues introduced by the added software layers are often under scrutiny. Since very little evaluation of large production HPC codes running in containers is available, we provide in this paper a comparative study using a production simulation of a biological system. The simulation is performed using Alya, which is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code optimized for HPC environments and enabled to run multiphysics problems. In the paper, we analyze the productivity advantages of adopting containers for large HPC codes, and we quantify performance overhead induced by the use of three different container technologies (Docker, Singularity and Shifter) comparing it to native execution. Given the results of these tests, we selected Singularity as best technology, based on performance and portability. We show scalability results of Alya using singularity up to 256 computational nodes (up to 12k cores) of MareNostrum4 and present a study of performance and portability on three different HPC architectures (Intel Skylake, IBM Power9, and Arm-v8).},

  abstract = {Interactive data visualization is imperative in the biological sciences. The development of independent layers of interactivity has been in pursuit in the visualization community. We developed bigPint, a data visualization package available on Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bigPint.html). Our software introduces new visualization technology that enables independent layers of interactivity using Plotly in R, which aids in the exploration of large biological datasets. The bigPint package presents modernized versions of scatterplot matrices, volcano plots, and litre plots through the implementation of layered interactivity. These graphics have detected normalization issues, differential expression designation problems, and common analysis errors in public RNA-sequencing datasets. Researchers can apply bigPint graphics to their data by following recommended pipelines written in reproducible code in the user manual. In this paper, we explain how we achieved the independent layers of interactivity that are behind bigPint graphics. Pseudocode and source code are provided. Computational scientists can leverage our open-source code to expand upon our layered interactive technology and/or apply it in new ways toward other computational biology tasks.},

  abstract = {The importance of finding people with undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) hinges on their future disease trajectories. Assays for systematic screening should be optimized to find those whose TB will contribute most to future transmission or morbidity. In this study, we constructed a mathematical model that tracks the future trajectories of individuals with TB at a cross-sectional timepoint (“baseline”), classifying them by bacterial burden (smear positive/negative) and symptom status (symptomatic/subclinical). We used Bayesian methods to calibrate this model to targets derived from historical survival data and notification, mortality, and prevalence data from five countries. We combined resulting disease trajectories with evidence on infectiousness to estimate each baseline TB state’s contribution to future transmission. For a person with smear-negative subclinical TB at baseline, the expected future duration of disease was short (mean 4.8 [95\% uncertainty interval 3.3 to 8.4] mo); nearly all disease courses ended in spontaneous resolution, not treatment. In contrast, people with baseline smear-positive subclinical TB had longer undiagnosed disease durations (15.9 [11.1 to 23.5] mo); nearly all eventually developed symptoms and ended in treatment or death. Despite accounting for only 11 to 19\% of prevalent disease, smear-positive subclinical TB accounted for 35 to 51\% of future transmission—a greater contribution than symptomatic or smear-negative TB. Subclinical TB with a high bacterial burden accounts for a disproportionate share of future transmission. Priority should be given to developing inexpensive, easy-to-use assays for screening both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals at scale—akin to rapid antigen tests for other diseases—even if these assays lack the sensitivity to detect paucibacillary disease.},

The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) computing a graphical representation of a data set (fuzzy simplicial complex) and (2) through stochastic gradient descent, optimizing a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we extend the second step of UMAP to a parametric optimization over neural network weights, learning a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We first demonstrate that parametric UMAP performs comparably to its nonparametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g., fast online embeddings for new data). We then explore UMAP as a regularization, constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, parametrically varying global structure preservation, and improving classifier accuracy for semisupervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.1},

Here we find that following Mtb infection MAIT cells mount minimal responses, and MAIT cell-deficient MR1               −/−               mice display normal survival. Preinfection expansion of MAIT cells through 5-OP-RU vaccination fails to protect against subsequent Mtb challenge. In fact, 5-OP-RU vaccination delays Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming in lung-draining lymph nodes, and conversely MR1 deficiency or blockade accelerates T cell priming. The MAIT cell-mediated delay in T cell priming is partly dependent on TGF-β. Surprisingly, 5-OP-RU treatment during chronic infection drives MAIT cell expansion and an IL-17A-dependent reduction in bacterial loads. Thus, during early infection MAIT cells directly contribute to the notoriously slow priming of CD4 T cells, but later during infection MAIT cell stimulation may be an effective host-directed therapy for tuberculosis.},

We previously showed that treatment of               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               infected mice with 5-OP-RU, a major antigen for MAIT cells, expands MAIT cells and enhances bacterial control. Here we treated               M. tuberculosis               infected rhesus macaques with 5-OP-RU intratracheally but found no clinical or microbiological benefit. In fact, after 5-OP-RU treatment MAIT cells did not expand, but rather upregulated PD-1 and lost the ability to produce multiple cytokines, a phenotype resembling T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we show that vaccination of uninfected macaques with 5-OP-RU+CpG instillation into the lungs also drives MAIT cell dysfunction, and PD-1 blockade during vaccination partly prevents the loss of MAIT cell function without facilitating their expansion. Thus, in rhesus macaques MAIT cells are prone to the loss of effector functions rather than expansion after TCR stimulation in vivo, representing a significant barrier to therapeutically targeting these cells.},

  abstract = {Crowd markets have traditionally limited workers by not providing transparency information concerning which tasks pay fairly or which requesters are unreliable. Researchers believe that a key reason why crowd workers earn low wages is due to this lack of transparency. As a result, tools have been developed to provide more transparency within crowd markets to help workers. However, while most workers use these tools, they still earn less than minimum wage. We argue that the missing element is guidance on how to use transparency information. In this paper, we explore how novice workers can improve their earnings by following the transparency criteria of Super Turkers, i.e., crowd workers who earn higher salaries on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We believe that Super Turkers have developed effective processes for using transparency information. Therefore, by having novices follow a Super Turker criteria (one that is simple and popular among Super Turkers), we can help novices increase their wages. For this purpose, we: (i) conducted a survey and data analysis to computationally identify a simple yet common criteria that Super Turkers use for handling transparency tools; (ii) deployed a two-week field experiment with novices who followed this Super Turker criteria to find better work on MTurk. Novices in our study viewed over 25,000 tasks by 1,394 requesters. We found that novices who utilized this Super Turkers’ criteria earned better wages than other novices. Our results highlight that tool development to support crowd workers should be paired with educational opportunities that teach workers how to effectively use the tools and their related metrics (e.g., transparency values). We finish with design recommendations for empowering crowd workers to earn higher salaries.},

The importance of these platforms in clinical and translational studies led us to investigate the impact of delayed blood processing on the numbers and state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the plasma proteome. Similar to previous studies, we show minimal effects of delayed processing on the numbers and general phenotype of PBMCs up to 18 hours. In contrast, profound changes in the single-cell transcriptome and composition of the plasma proteome become evident as early as 6 hours after blood draw. These reflect patterns of cellular activation across diverse cell types that lead to progressive distancing of the gene expression state and plasma proteome from native in vivo biology. Differences accumulating during an overnight rest (18 hours) could confound relevant biologic variance related to many underlying disease states.},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that conformational change in the β               2               -integrin is a very early activation marker that can be detected with fluorescent multimers of its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 for rapid assessment of antigen-specific CD8               +               T cells. In this study, we describe a modified protocol of this assay for sensitive detection of functional antigen-specific CD4               +               T cells using a monoclonal antibody (clone m24 Ab) specific for the open, high-affinity conformation of the β               2               -integrin. The kinetics of β               2               -integrin activation was different on CD4               +               and CD8               +               T cells (several hours vs. few minutes, respectively); however, m24 Ab readily stained both cell types 4–6 h after antigen stimulation. With this protocol, we were able to monitor               ex vivo               effector and memory CD4               +               and CD8               +               T cells specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in whole blood or cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected or vaccinated individuals. By costaining β               2               -integrin with m24 and CD154 Abs, we assessed extremely low frequencies of polyfunctional CD4               +               T cell responses. The novel assay used in this study allows very sensitive and simultaneous screening of both CD4               +               and CD8               +               T cell reactivities, with versatile applicability in clinical and vaccination studies.},

  abstract = {This lively book lays out a methodology of confidence distributions and puts them through their paces. Among other merits, they lead to optimal combinations of confidence from different sources of information, and they can make complex models amenable to objective and indeed prior-free analysis for less subjectively inclined statisticians. The generous mixture of theory, illustrations, applications and exercises is suitable for statisticians at all levels of experience, as well as for data-oriented scientists. Some confidence distributions are less dispersed than their competitors. This concept leads to a theory of risk functions and comparisons for distributions of confidence. Neyman–Pearson type theorems leading to optimal confidence are developed and richly illustrated. Exact and optimal confidence distribution is the gold standard for inferred epistemic distributions. Confidence distributions and likelihood functions are intertwined, allowing prior distributions to be made part of the likelihood. Meta-analysis in likelihood terms is developed and taken beyond traditional methods, suiting it in particular to combining information across diverse data sources.},

  abstract = {Modified vaccinia Ankara-expressing Ag85A (MVA85A) is a new tuberculosis (TB) vaccine aimed at enhancing immunity induced by BCG. We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A in healthy adolescents and children from a TB endemic region, who received BCG at birth. Twelve adolescents and 24 children were vaccinated and followed up for 12 or 6 months, respectively. Adverse events were documented and vaccine-induced immune responses assessed by IFN-γ ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining. The vaccine was well tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. MVA85A induced potent and durable T-cell responses. Multiple CD4+ T-cell subsets, based on expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-17 and GM-CSF, were induced. Polyfunctional CD4+ T cells co-expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 dominated the response in both age groups. A novel CD4+ cell subset co-expressing these three Th1 cytokines and IL-17 was induced in adolescents, while a novel CD4+ T-cell subset co-expressing Th1 cytokines and GM-CSF was induced in children. Ag-specific CD8+ T cells were not detected. We conclude that in adolescents and children MVA85A safely induces the type of immunity thought to be important in protection against TB. This includes induction of novel Th1-cell populations that have not been previously described in humans.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccines should be safe and effective in populations infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and/or HIV for effective TB control. Objective: To determine the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A, a novel TB vaccine, among M.tb- and/or HIV-infected persons in a setting where TB and HIV are endemic. Methods: An open-label, phase IIa trial was conducted in 48 adults with M.tb and/or HIV infection. Safety and immunogenicity were analyzed up to 52 weeks after intradermal vaccination with 5 × 107 plaque-forming units of MVA85A. Specific T-cell responses were characterized by IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot and whole blood intracellular cytokine staining assays. Measurements and Main Results: MVA85A was well tolerated and no vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. MVA85A induced robust and durable response of mostly polyfunctional CD4+ T cells, coexpressing IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-2. Magnitudes of pre- and postvaccination T-cell responses were lower in HIV-infected, compared with HIV-uninfected, vaccinees. No significant effect of antiretroviral therapy on immunogenicity of MVA85A was observed. Conclusions: MVA85A was safe and immunogenic in persons with HIV and/or M.tb infection. These results support further evaluation of safety and efficacy of this vaccine for prevention of TB in these target populations.},

  abstract = {Immunology is a central theme when it comes to tuberculosis (TB). The outcome of human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is dependent on the ability of the immune response to clear or contain the infection. In cases where this fails, the bacterium replicates, disseminates within the host, and elicits a pathologic inflammatory response, and disease ensues. Clinical presentation of TB disease is remarkably heterogenous, and the disease phenotype is largely dependent on host immune status. Onward transmission of M. tuberculosis to new susceptible hosts is thought to depend on an excessive inflammatory response causing a breakdown of the lung matrix and formation of lung cavities, but this varies in cases of underlying immunological dysfunction: for example, HIV is associated with less cavitation, while diabetes mellitus is associated with increased cavitation and risk of transmission. In compliance with the central theme of immunology in tuberculosis, we rely on detection of an adaptive immune response, in the form of interferon-gamma release assays or tuberculin skin tests, to diagnose infection with M. tuberculosis. Here we review the immunology of tuberculosis in the human host, focusing on cellular and humoral adaptive immunity as well as key features of innate immune responses and the underlying immunological dysfunction which associates with human TB risk factors. Our review is restricted to human immunology, and we highlight distinctions from the immunological dogma originating from animal models of tuberculosis, which pervade the field.},

Especially in complex statistical analyses—such as the analysis of longitudinal data—reproducing results is far from simple, especially if no source code is available. In this work we aimed to reproduce analyses of longitudinal data of 11 articles published in PLOS ONE. Inclusion criteria were the availability of data and author consent. We investigated the types of methods and software used and whether we were able to reproduce the data analysis using open source software. Most articles provided overview tables and simple visualisations. Generalised Estimating Equations (GEEs) were the most popular statistical models among the selected articles. Only one article used open source software and only one published part of the analysis code. Replication was difficult in most cases and required reverse engineering of results or contacting the authors. For three articles we were not able to reproduce the results, for another two only parts of them. For all but two articles we had to contact the authors to be able to reproduce the results. Our main learning is that reproducing papers is difficult if no code is supplied and leads to a high burden for those conducting the reproductions. Open data policies in journals are good, but to truly boost reproducibility we suggest adding open code policies.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} Flow and mass cytometry are important modern immunology tools for measuring expression levels of multiple proteins on single cells. The goal is to better understand the mechanisms of responses on a single cell basis by studying differential expression of proteins. Most current data analysis tools compare expressions across many computationally discovered cell types. Our goal is to focus on just one cell type. Our narrower field of application allows us to define a more specific statistical model with easier to control statistical guarantees. Results:\enspace{} Differential analysis of marker expressions can be difficult due to marker cor‑relations and inter-subject heterogeneity, particularly for studies of human immunol‑ogy. We address these challenges with two multiple regression strategies: a boot‑strapped generalized linear model and a generalized linear mixed model. On simulated datasets, we compare the robustness towards marker correlations and heterogeneity of both strategies. For paired experiments, we find that both strategies maintain the target false discovery rate under medium correlations and that mixed models are statistically more powerful under the correct model specification. For unpaired experi‑ments, our results indicate that much larger patient sample sizes are required to detect differences. We illustrate the CytoGLMM R package and workflow for both strategies on a pregnancy dataset. Conclusion:\enspace{} Our approach to finding differential proteins in flow and mass cytom‑etry data reduces biases arising from marker correlations and safeguards against false discoveries induced by patient heterogeneity.},

Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Modern scientific studies often require the identification of a subset of explanatory variables. Several statistical methods have been developed to automate this task, and the framework of knockoffs has been proposed as a general solution for variable selection under rigorous Type I error control, without relying on strong modelling assumptions. In this paper, we extend the methodology of knockoffs to problems where the distribution of the covariates can be described by a hidden Markov model. We develop an exact and efficient algorithm to sample knockoff variables in this setting and then argue that, combined with the existing selective framework, this provides a natural and powerful tool for inference in genome-wide association studies with guaranteed false discovery rate control. We apply our method to datasets on Crohn’s disease and some continuous phenotypes.},

It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing challenges with big data and ensuring reproducibility in biology. However, despite their advantages, cloud platforms in and of themselves do not automatically support FAIRness. The global push to develop biomedical cloud platforms has led to new challenges, including platform lock-in, difficulty integrating across platforms, and duplicated effort for both users and developers. Here, we argue that these difficulties are systemic and emerge from incentives that encourage development effort on self-sufficient platforms and data repositories instead of interoperable microservices. We argue that many of these issues would be alleviated by prioritizing microservices and access to modular data in smaller chunks or summarized form. We propose that emphasizing modularity and interoperability would lead to a more powerful Unix-like ecosystem of web services for biomedical analysis and data retrieval. We challenge funders, developers, and researchers to support a vision to improve interoperability through microservices as the next generation of cloud-based bioinformatics.},

Among them, dataset repositories fill the gap of providing long-term preservation of diverse kinds of data along with its meta-descriptions, and support citation. Unsurprisingly, the concern for quality arises as in the publication of papers. However, repositories support a larger variety of use cases, and many of them implement minimal control on the data uploaded by users. An approach to tackle with quality control in repositories is that of letting communities of users to filter the relevant resources for them, at the same time providing some form of trust to users of the data. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the extent to which this social approach that relies on communities self-organizing actually contributes to the effective organization inside repositories. This paper reports the results of a study on the Zenodo repository, describing its main contents and how communities have emerged naturally around the deposited contents.},

Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A survey was undertaken to determine the distribution of tuberculosis in England and Wales and, by comparison with the findings of similar surveys in 1978-9 and 1983, to study trends in the incidence of the disease by ethnic group over the decade. METHODS: The survey included all cases of tuberculosis in England and Wales newly notified to the medical officers for environmental health during the six months from 2 January to 1 July 1988. Notification rates were calculated from population estimates from the 1988 Labour Force Survey. RESULTS: Clinical details were obtained from the clinician for 2149 (99.4\%) of the 2163 newly notified and previously untreated patients. Over 90\% were either white (53\%) or of Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi ethnic origin (39\%). The notification rate in the white population was 4.7/100,000/year, a decline of 7.2\% per year since 1978. The rate was 134.6/100,000/year in the population of Indian ethnic origin, and 100.5/100,000/year in that of Pakistani or Bangladeshi ethnic origin, a decline of 6\% a year since 1978 for the two groups combined (standardised for age, country of birth, and length of time in the UK). In all ethnic groups rates of disease were much higher in the elderly than in the young. Bacteriological results were available in 1161 (80\%) of the 1443 pulmonary cases. In 939 (81\%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured; 614 cases (53\%) also had positive smears, of which 424 (69\%) were from white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Notification rates for tuberculosis in England and Wales declined over the decade, but major differences remained between ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {A nonsputum triage test to rule out tuberculosis (TB) disease is a WHO high-priority diagnostic, and a combinatory score based on a 3-gene host signature has shown promise in discriminating TB from other illnesses. We evaluated the accuracy of an early-prototype cartridge assay (“Xpert MTB Host Response” or Xpert-MTBHR-Prototype) of this 3-gene signature on biobanked blood samples from people living with HIV (PLHIV) against a comprehensive microbiological reference standard (CMRS) and against Xpert MTB/RIF on the first sputum sample alone. We depict results based on performance targets set by the WHO in comparison with a laboratory-based C-reactive protein (CRP) assay. Of 201 patients included, 67 were culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The areas under the concentration-time curve (AUCs) for Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype were 0.89 (confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 0.94) against the CMRS and 0.94 (CI, 0.89 to 0.98) against Xpert MTB/RIF. Considering Xpert-MTB-HRPrototype as a triage test (at the nearest upper value of sensitivity to 90\%), specificities were 55.8\% (CI, 47.2 to 64.1\%) compared to the CMRS and 85.9\% (CI, 79.3 to 90.7\%) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF as confirmatory tests. Considering Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype as a stand-alone diagnostic test, at a specificity near 95\%, the test achieved a sensitivity of 65.7\% (CI, 53.7 to 75.9\%), while the CRP assay achieved a sensitivity of only 13.6\% (CI, 7.3 to 23.4\%). In this first accuracy study of a prototype blood-based host marker assay, we show the possible value of the assay for triage and diagnosis in PLHIV.},

  abstract = {In real-world classification tasks, each class often comprises multiple finer-grained "subclasses." As the subclass labels are frequently unavailable, models trained using only the coarser-grained class labels often exhibit highly variable performance across different subclasses. This phenomenon, known as hidden stratification, has important consequences for models deployed in safety-critical applications such as medicine. We propose GEORGE, a method to both measure and mitigate hidden stratification even when subclass labels are unknown. We first observe that unlabeled subclasses are often separable in the feature space of deep models, and exploit this fact to estimate subclass labels for the training data via clustering techniques. We then use these approximate subclass labels as a form of noisy supervision in a distributionally robust optimization objective. We theoretically characterize the performance of GEORGE in terms of the worst-case generalization error across any subclass. We empirically validate GEORGE on a mix of real-world and benchmark image classification datasets, and show that our approach boosts worst-case subclass accuracy by up to 22 percentage points compared to standard training techniques, without requiring any information about the subclasses.},

  abstract = {Storing scientific data on the filesystem in a meaningful and transparent way is no trivial task. In particular, when the data have to be accessed after their originator has left the lab, the importance of a standardized filesystem layout cannot be underestimated. It is desirable to have a structure that allows for the unique categorization of all kinds of data from experimental results to publications. They have to be accessible to a broad variety of workflows, e.g., via graphical user interface as well as via command line, in order to find widespread acceptance. Furthermore, the inclusion of already existing data has to be as simple as possible. We propose a three-level layout to organize and store scientific data that incorporates the full chain of scientific data management from data acquisition to analysis to publications. Metadata are saved in a standardized way and connect original data to analyses and publications as well as to their originators. A simple software tool to check a file structure for compliance with the proposed structure is presented.},

While many statistical methods are available to identify differentially expressed genes, the principles that distinguish these methods and their performance remain unclear. Here, we show that the relative performance of these methods is contingent on their ability to account for variation between biological replicates. Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences. To exemplify these principles, we exposed true and false discoveries of differentially expressed genes in the injured mouse spinal cord.},

Stimulation of nasal CD8               +               T cells with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides elevates expression of CD107a at 2- and 6-months (               p               \,=\,0.0096) post second vaccine dose, with a subset of donors also expressing increased cytokines. These data suggest that nasal T cells may be induced and contribute to the protective immunity afforded by this vaccine.},

Serum samples from 2,174 Ugandan individuals were investigated for HCMV antibodies and data linked to demographic information, co-infections and a variety of CVD measurements. HCMV seropositivity was 83\% by one year of age, increasing to 95\% by five years. Female sex, HIV positivity and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were associated with an increase in HCMV IgG levels in adjusted analyses. There was no evidence of any associations with risk factors for CVD after adjusting for age and sex. HCMV infection is ubiquitous in this rural Ugandan cohort from a young age. The association between TB disease and high HCMV IgG levels merits further research. Known CVD risk factors do not appear to be associated with higher HCMV antibody levels in this Ugandan cohort.},

Methods.{$\quad$} This nested case-control study used stored serum samples from 25 persons with tuberculosis up to 10 years before tuberculosis diagnosis and between 3 and 6 matched controls without tuberculosis from a rural Ugandan cohort. Samples were investigated for Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and HCMV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), serum markers of inflammation, and mycobacterial antibody levels. Results.{$\quad$} Humoral response to HCMV, but not Epstein-Barr or herpes simplex virus, was associated with increased risk of active tuberculosis disease up to 10 years before diagnosis. Individuals with medium HCMV IgG were 2.8 times more likely to have tuberculosis (P = .055), and those with high HCMV IgG 3.4 times more likely to have tuberculosis (P = .007). Mycobacterial antibody levels were not associated with differences in odds of tuberculosis disease. Interferon-induced protein 10 was independently associated with increased odds of tuberculosis (odds ratio, 4.2; P = .009). Conclusions.{$\quad$} These data provide evidence of a dose response between magnitude of HCMV IgG with risk of tuberculosis disease. An inflammatory environment, characterized by serum interferon-induced protein 10 and interleukin 1α, is independently associated with increased risk of tuberculosis disease.},

  abstract = {The ability to independently regenerate published computational claims is widely recognized as a key component of scientific reproducibility. In this article we take a narrow interpretation of this goal, and attempt to regenerate published claims from author-supplied information, including data, code, inputs, and other provided specifications, on a different computational system than that used by the original authors. We are motivated by Claerbout and Donoho's exhortation of the importance of providing complete information for reproducibility of the published claim. We chose the Elsevier journal, the Journal of Computational Physics, which has stated author guidelines that encourage the availability of computational digital artifacts that support scholarly findings. In an IRB approved study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (IRB \#17329) we gathered artifacts from a sample of authors who published in this journal in 2016 and 2017. We then used the ICERM criteria generated at the 2012 ICERM workshop "Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics" to evaluate the sufficiency of the information provided in the publications and the ease with which the digital artifacts afforded computational reproducibility. We find that, for the articles for which we obtained computational artifacts, we could not easily regenerate the findings for 67\% of them, and we were unable to easily regenerate all the findings for any of the articles. We then evaluated the artifacts we did obtain (55 of 306 articles) and find that the main barriers to computational reproducibility are inadequate documentation of code, data, and workflow information (70.9\%), missing code function and setting information, and missing licensing information (75\%). We recommend improvements based on these findings, including the deposit of supporting digital artifacts for reproducibility as a condition of publication, and verification of computational findings via re-execution of the code when possible.},

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%. We find this policy—author remission of data and code postpublication upon request—an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.},

Scientific research produces more scholarship than the final paper: for example, the code, data structures, experimental design and parameters, documentation, and figures, are all important both for communication of the scholarship and replication of the results. US copyright law is a barrier to the sharing of scientific scholarship since it establishes exclusive rights for creators over their work, thereby limiting the ability of others to copy, use, build upon, or alter the research. This is precisely opposite to prevailing scientific norms, which provide both that results be replicated before accepted as knowledge, and that scientific understanding be built upon previous discoveries for which authorship recognition is given. In accordance with these norms and to encourage the release of all scientific scholarship, I propose the Reproducible Research Standard (RRS) both to ensure attribution and facilitate the sharing of scientific works. Using the RRS on all components of scientific scholarship will encourage reproducible scientific investigation, facilitate greater collaboration, and promote engagement of the larger community in scientific learning and discovery.},

An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as ‘features’), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have a significant impact on the clustering accuracy. All existing scRNA-seq clustering tools include a feature selection step relying on some simple unsupervised feature selection methods, mostly based on the statistical moments of gene-wise expression distributions. In this work, we carefully evaluate the impact of feature selection on cell clustering accuracy. In addition, we develop a feature selection algorithm named FEAture SelecTion (FEAST), which provides more representative features. We apply the method on 12 public scRNA-seq datasets and demonstrate that using features selected by FEAST with existing clustering tools significantly improve the clustering accuracy.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

We performed a phase I randomized controlled trial of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) before revaccination with bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) in healthy, tuberculin skin test–positive (≥15-mm induration), HIV-negative South African adults. We hypothesized that preclearance of latent bacilli with IPT modulates BCG immunogenicity following revaccination. Frequencies and coexpression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-17, and/or IL-22 in CD4 T cells and IFN-γ–expressing CD8 T, γδ T, CD3+CD56+ NKT-like, and NK cells in response to BCG were measured using whole blood intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. We analyzed 72 participants who were revaccinated with BCG after IPT (n = 33) or without prior IPT (n = 39). IPT had little effect on frequencies or cytokine coexpression patterns of M. tuberculosis– or BCG-specific responses. Revaccination transiently boosted BCG-specific Th1 cytokine-expressing CD4, CD8, and γδ T cells. Despite high frequencies of IFN-γ–expressing BCG-reactive CD3+CD56+ NKT-like cells and CD3−CD56dim and CD3−CD56hi NK cells at baseline, BCG revaccination boosted these responses, which remained elevated up to 1 y after revaccination. Such BCG-reactive memory NK cells were induced by BCG vaccination in infants, whereas in vitro IFN-γ expression by NK cells upon BCG stimulation was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18. Our data suggest that isoniazid preclearance of M. tuberculosis bacilli has little effect on the magnitude, persistence, or functional attributes of lymphocyte responses boosted by BCG revaccination. Our study highlights the surprising durability of BCG-boosted memory NKT-like and NK cells expressing antimycobacterial effector molecules, which may be novel targets for tuberculosis vaccines.},

  abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are well-known techniques for feature extraction from two sets of multidimensional variables. The fundamental difference between CCA and PLS is that CCA maximizes the correlation while PLS maximizes the covariance. Although both CCA and PLS have been applied successfully in various applications, the intrinsic relationship between them remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by showing the equivalence relationship between CCA and orthonormalized partial least squares (OPLS), a variant of PLS. We further extend the equivalence relationship to the case when regularization is employed for both sets of variables. In addition, we show that the CCA projection for one set of variables is independent of the regularization on the other set of variables. We have performed experimental studies using both synthetic and real data sets and our results confirm the established equivalence relationship. The presented analysis provides novel insights into the connection between these two existing algorithms as well as the effect of the regularization.},

Many in silico methods have been developed and can be roughly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. In this study, we investigated the performances of 8 supervised and 10 unsupervised cell type identification methods using 14 public scRNA-seq datasets of different tissues, sequencing protocols and species. We investigated the impacts of a number of factors, including total amount of cells, number of cell types, sequencing depth, batch effects, reference bias, cell population imbalance, unknown/novel cell type, and computational efficiency and scalability. Instead of merely comparing individual methods, we focused on factors’ impacts on the general category of supervised and unsupervised methods. We found that in most scenarios, the supervised methods outperformed the unsupervised methods, except for the identification of unknown cell types. This is particularly true when the supervised methods use a reference dataset with high informational sufficiency, low complexity and high similarity to the query dataset. However, such outperformance could be undermined by some undesired dataset properties investigated in this study, which lead to uninformative and biased reference datasets. In these scenarios, unsupervised methods could be comparable to supervised methods. Our study not only explained the cell typing methods’ behaviors under different experimental settings but also provided a general guideline for the choice of method according to the scientific goal and dataset properties. Finally, our evaluation workf low is implemented as a modularized R pipeline that allows future evaluation of new methods.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of BCG vaccination, at about age 13 years, in the prevention of tuberculosis at ages 15–24 years in England and Wales in 1983, has been determined by the same method as in two previous surveys in 1973 and 1978. In 1983, the tuberculosis notification rate among those vaccinated in the schools' scheme was 3.30 per 100 000, compared with an estimated rate of 13.20 per 100 000 among those who were tuberculin negative and not vaccinated in the scheme. The protective effectiveness of BCG vaccination at ages 15–24 years in England and Wales in 1983 is thus estimated as 75 \%; the estimated efficacy in the white ethnic group is closely similar, namely 76 \%. The estimated efficacy of BCG at ages 15–19 and 20–24 years in the three surveys, both in the white ethnic group and in the entire cohort, has been compared with that found in the Medical Research Council's controlled trial of tuberculosis vaccines which began in 1950. There is no evidence of any decrease in the protective efficacy of BCG vaccination between the four cohorts of young adults, which span a total period of 29 years. However, there were steep decreases between the cohorts in the annual notification rates for the white ethnic group; these decreases occurred in the BCG vaccinated and in the tuberculin negative unvaccinated groups, as well as among those found tuberculin positive (and not vaccinated) in the schools' scheme. It is concluded that the level of protective efficacy of BCG vaccination at ages 15–24 years is high, and has remained unchanged since the start of the BCG in schools' scheme. However, as the tuberculosis notification rate in young adults has decreased steeply throughout this period, and is continuing to decrease, the benefits to be expected from the BCG in schools' scheme will decrease equally rapidly. Résumé L'efficacité de la vaccination BCG pratiquée a l'âge de 13 ans environ, en vue de la prévention de la tuberculose chez des sujets ages de 15 à 24 ans en Angleterre et au Pays de Galles en 1983 a été évaluée par la même méthode utilisée lors de deux études antérieures réalisées en 1973 et 1978. En 1983, le taux de déclaration de la tuberculose parmi les sujets vaccines dans le cadre du programme scolaire a été de 3,30 pour 100.000, comparé au taux de 13,20 pour 100.000 estimé chez les sujets trouvés négatifs au test tuberculinique et non vaccinés dans le cadre de ce programme. Ainsi, la protection conférée par le BCG chez les sujets âgés de 15–24 ans en Angleterre et au Pays de Galles en 1983 est estimée a 75 \%; l'efficacité estimée clans le groupe ethnique blanc est pratiquement le même (76 \%) que dans l'ensemble de la population étudiée. L'efficacité estimée du BCG chez les sujets âgés de 15–19 ans et de 20–24 ans dans les trois études, aussi bien clans le groupe ethnique blanc que clans la cohorte complete, a été comparée à celle trouvée clans l'essai contrôlé des vaccins antituberculeux du Medical Research Council commencé en 1950. Aucune diminution de la protection conféŕee par la vaccination BCG n'a été constateé dans les quatre cohortes de jeunes adultes qui couvrait au total une période de 29 ans. Cependant, une diminution accentuée des taux annuels de declaration a été observée clans les cohortes du groupe blanc; cette diminution a été constatée aussi bien clans les groupes des sujets vaccinés par le BCG et les groupes de sujets non vaccinés tuberculino-négatifs, que clans les groupes considérés comme tuberculino-positifs (et non vaccinés) clans le programme scolaire. Les auteurs concluent que le niveau de protection conféré par la vaccination BCG à l'âge de 15–24 and est élevé et qu'il se maintient sans modification depuis le début du programme scolaire de vaccination BCG. Néanmoins, étant donné que le taux de déclaration de tuberculose chez les jeunes adultes a diminué de façon marquée tout au long de cette période, et qu'il continue à diminuer, les bénéfices espérés du programme de vaccination BCG clans les écoles climinueront avec la même rapidité. Resumen En 1983, en Inglaterra y Gales se evaluó le eficacia de la vacunacion con BCG practicade a los de 13 anos de edad con fines de prevenir la tuberculosis a la edad de 15–24 añons, con el mismo método utilizado en los dos estudios anteriores realizados en 1973 y 1978. En 1983 la tasa de notificatión de la tuberculosis entre los sujetos vacunados en el programa escolar era 3.30 por 100 000 comparada con una tasa estimada de 13,20 por 100 000 en los sujetos que eran tuberculino-negativos y no vacunados durante la realización de este programa. Así, la protección conferida por el BCG a la edad de 15–24 años en Inglaterra y Gales en 1983 se estimó en 75 \%; la eficacia estimada en el grupo etnico blanco fue prácticamente la misma que en el total de la población estudiada, es decir 76 \%. Se comparó la eficacia estimada del BCG a las edades de 15–19 y de 20–24 años en los tres estudios, tanto en el grupo blanco como en el total de la cohorte, con aquélla encontrada en el estudio controlado del Medical Research Council sobre las vacunas antituberculosas que comenzó en 1950. No se constató ninguna disminución de la protección conferida por la vacunación con BCG en las cuatro cohortes de adultos jóvenes que cubrian en total un periodo de 29 anos. Sin embargo, en las cohortes del grupo bianco se observó una disminución acentuada de las tasas anuales de notificacion; esta disminmución se constató tanto en los grupos de sujetos vacunados con BCG y en los no vacunados tuberculino-negativos como en aquéllos considerados como tuberculino-positivos (y no vacunados) en el programa escolar. Los autores concluyen que el nivel de protección conferido por la vacunación con BCG a la edad de 15–24 anos es elevado y que se mantiene sin modificación desde el comienzo del programa escolar de vacunación con BCG. No obstante, dado que la tasa de notificacion de tuberculosis en los adultos jóvenes ha disminuido de manera acentuada a to largo de este periodo y que continua disaminuyendo, los beneficios esperados del programa de vacunación con BCG en las escuelas disminuirán con la misma rapidez.},

  abstract = {Findings from clinical and biological studies are often not reproducible when tested in independent cohorts. Due to the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, results from whole-genome expression studies in particular are often not reproducible. Compared to singlestudy analysis, gene expression meta-analysis can improve reproducibility by integrating data from multiple studies. However, there are multiple choices in designing and carrying out a meta-analysis. Yet, clear guidelines on best practices are scarce. Here, we hypothesized that studying subsets of very large meta-analyses would allow for systematic identification of best practices to improve reproducibility. We therefore constructed three very large gene expression meta-analyses from clinical samples, and then examined meta-analyses of subsets of the datasets (all combinations of datasets with up to N/2 samples and K/2 datasets) compared to a ‘silver standard’ of differentially expressed genes found in the entire cohort. We tested three random-effects meta-analysis models using this procedure. We showed relatively greater reproducibility with more-stringent effect size thresholds with relaxed significance thresholds; relatively lower reproducibility when imposing extraneous constraints on residual heterogeneity; and an underestimation of actual false positive rate by Benjamini–Hochberg correction. In addition, multivariate regression showed that the accuracy of a meta-analysis increased significantly with more included datasets even when controlling for sample size.},

In transgenic mice, the beneficial effect of CRP depends largely on its ability to recruit complement, Fcg receptors and the adaptive immune system; but this function is not limited to the blood-borne protein nor does it require a substantial rise in blood CRP levels. Moreover, in clinical studies, we have observed that differences in baseline levels of CRP among individuals correlate with a polymorphism in the CRP gene. The relevance of this finding is underlined by the observation that subtle elevation of blood CRP is associated with significantly increased risk of cardiac disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Results of an earlier analysis of a trial of the M72/AS01E candidate vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis showed that in infected adults, the vaccine provided 54.0\% protection against active pulmonary tuberculosis disease, without evident safety concerns. We now report the results of the 3-year final analysis of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. METHODS From August 2014 through November 2015, we enrolled adults 18 to 50 years of age with M. tuberculosis infection (defined by positive results on interferon-γ release assay) without evidence of active tuberculosis disease at centers in Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either M72/AS01E or placebo, administered 1 month apart. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of M72/AS01E to prevent active pulmonary tuberculosis disease according to the first case definition (bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis not associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection). Participants were followed for 3 years after the second dose. Participants with clinical suspicion of tuberculosis provided sputum samples for polymerase-chain-reaction assay, mycobacterial culture, or both. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated until month 36 in a subgroup of 300 participants. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of M72/AS01E or placebo. RESULTS A total of 3575 participants underwent randomization, of whom 3573 received at least one dose of M72/AS01E or placebo, and 3330 received both planned doses. Among the 3289 participants in the according-to-protocol efficacy cohort, 13 of the 1626 participants in the M72/AS01E group, as compared with 26 of the 1663 participants in the placebo group, had cases of tuberculosis that met the first case definition (incidence, 0.3 vs. 0.6 cases per 100 person-years). The vaccine efficacy at month 36 was 49.7\% (90\% confidence interval [CI], 12.1 to 71.2; 95\% CI, 2.1 to 74.2). Among participants in the M72/AS01E group, the concentrations of M72-specific antibodies and the frequencies of M72-specific CD4+ T cells increased after the first dose and were sustained throughout the follow-up period. Serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, and deaths occurred with similar frequencies in the two groups.

  abstract = {Background New tuberculosis (TB) vaccines are being developed to combat the global epidemic. A phase IIb trial of a candidate vaccine, MVA85A, was conducted in a high burden setting in South Africa to evaluate proof-of-concept efficacy for prevention of TB in infants. Objective To describe the study design and implementation lessons from an infant TB vaccine efficacy trial. Methods This was a randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of MVA85A to Candin control administered to 4–6-month-old, BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative infants at a rural site in South Africa. Infants were followed up for 15–39 months for incident TB disease based on pre-specified endpoints. Results 2797 infants were enrolled over 22 months. Factors adversely affecting recruitment and the solutions that were implemented are discussed. Slow case accrual led to six months extension of trial follow up. Conclusion The clinical, regulatory and research environment for modern efficacy trials of new TB vaccines are substantially different to that when BCG vaccine was first evaluated in infants. Future infant TB vaccine trials will need to allocate sufficient resources and optimise operational efficiency. A stringent TB case definition is necessary to maximize specificity, and TB case accrual must be monitored closely.},

The many available enriched stable isotopes of the transition elements can provide up to 100 distinguishable reporting tags, which can be measured simultaneously because of the essential independence of detection provided by the mass spectrometer. We discuss the adaptation of traditional inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to cytometry applications. We focus on the generation of cytometrycompatible data and on approaches to unsupervised multivariate clustering analysis. Finally, we provide a highlevel review of some recent benchmark reports that highlight the potential for massively multi-parameter mass cytometry.},

  abstract = {Automated radiologic analysis using computer-aided detection software (CAD) could facilitate chest X-ray (CXR) use in tuberculosis diagnosis. There is little to no evidence on the accuracy of commercially-available deep learning-based CAD in different populations, including patients with smear-negative tuberculosis and people living with HIV (PLWH).We collected CXRs and individual patient data (IPD) from studies evaluating CAD in patients self-referring for tuberculosis symptoms with culture or nucleic acid amplification testing as the reference. We re-analyzed CXRs with three CAD (CAD4TB version (v) 6, Lunit v3.1.0.0, and qXR v2). We estimated sensitivity and specificity within each study and pooled using IPD meta-analysis. We used multivariable meta-regression to identify characteristics modifying accuracy.We included CXRs and IPD of 3727/3967 participants from 4/7 eligible studies. 17\% (621/3727) were PLWH. 17\% (645/3727) had microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis. Despite using the same threshold score for classifying CXR in every study, sensitivity and specificity varied from study to study. The software had similar unadjusted accuracy (at 90\% pooled sensitivity, pooled specificities were: CAD4TBv6, 56.9\% [95\%CI:51.7-61.9]; Lunit, 54.1\% [44.6-63.3]; qXRv2, 60.5\% [51.7-68.6]). Adjusted absolute differences in pooled sensitivity between PLWH and HIV-uninfected participants was: CAD4TBv6, -13.4\% [-21.1, -6.9]; Lunit, +2.2\% [-3.6, +6.3]; qXRv2: -13.4\% [-21.5, -6.6]); between smear-negative and smear-positive tuberculosis was: CAD4TBv6, -12.3\% [-19.5, -6.1]; Lunit, -17.2\% [-24.6, -10.5]; qXRv2, -16.6\% [-24.4, -9.9]. Accuracy was similar to human readers.For CAD CXR analysis to be implemented as a high-sensitivity tuberculosis rule-out test, users will need threshold scores identified from their own patient populations, and stratified by HIV- and smear-status.},

The fact that we have “cherry-picked”—searched for the strongest associations—means that we must set a higher bar for declaring significant the associations that we see. This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated. We describe some recent new developments in selective inference and illustrate their use in forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis.},

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

For individual researchers, sharing research artifacts such as data can increase trust and transparency, improve the reproducibility of one’s own work, and catalyze new collaborations.

  abstract = {HPC centers are facing increasing demand for greater software flexibility to support faster and more diverse innovation in computational scientific work. Containers, which use Linux kernel features to allow a user to substitute their own software stack for that installed on the host, are an increasingly popular method to provide this flexibility. Because standard container technologies such as Docker are unsuitable for HPC, three HPC-specific technologies have emerged: Charliecloud, Shifter, and Singularity. A common concern is that containers may introduce performance overhead. To our knowledge, no comprehensive, rigorous, HPC-focused assessment of container performance has previously been performed. Our present experiment compares the performance of all three HPC container implementations and bare metal on multiple dimensions using industry-standard benchmarks (SysBench, STREAM, and HPCG). We found no meaningful performance differences between the four environments, with the possible exception of modest variation in memory usage. These results suggest that HPC users should feel free to containerize their applications without concern about performance degradation, regardless of the container technology used. It is an encouraging development towards greater adoption of user-defined software stacks to increase the flexibility of HPC systems.},

Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals’ collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

Although influenza vaccines have been licensed and used for decades, the potential correlates of protection induced by these vaccines are still a matter of discussion. Currently, inactivated vaccines are the most common and the haemagglutination inhibition antibody titer is regarded as an immunological correlate of protection and the best available parameter for predicting protection from influenza infection. However, the assay shows some limitations, such as its low sensitivity to B and avian strains and inter-laboratory variability. Additional assays and next-generation vaccines have been evaluated to overcome the limitations of the traditional serological techniques and to elicit broad immune responses, underlining the need to revise the current correlates of protection. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current scenario regarding the immunological evaluation and correlates of protection of influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {The adaptation of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to a new vector, the Aedes albopictus mosquito, is a major factor contributing to its ongoing re-emergence in a series of large-scale epidemics of arthritic disease in many parts of the world since 2004. Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

  abstract = {Next generation sequencing is quickly replacing microarrays as a technique to probe different molecular levels of the cell, such as DNA or RNA. The technology provides higher resolution, while reducing bias. RNA sequencing results in counts of RNA strands. This type of data imposes new statistical challenges. We present a novel, generic approach to model and analyze such data. Our approach aims at large flexibility of the likelihood (count) model and the regression model alike. Hence, a variety of count models is supported, such as the popular NB model, which accounts for overdispersion. In addition, complex, non-balanced designs and random effects are accommodated. Like some other methods, our method provides shrinkage of dispersion-related parameters. However, we extend it by enabling joint shrinkage of parameters, including those for which inference is desired. We argue that this is essential for Bayesian multiplicity correction. Shrinkage is effectuated by empirically estimating priors. We discuss several parametric (mixture) and non-parametric priors and develop procedures to estimate (parameters of) those. Inference is provided by means of local and Bayesian false discovery rates. We illustrate our method on several simulations and two data sets, also to compare it with other methods. Model- and data-based simulations show substantial improvements in the sensitivity at the given specificity. The data motivate the use of the ZI-NB as a powerful alternative to the NB, which results in higher detection rates for low-count data. Finally, compared with other methods, the results on small sample subsets are more reproducible when validated on their large sample complements, illustrating the importance of the type of shrinkage.},

Although this provides a wealth of information, it becomes infeasible to analyze these datasets manually. When using 2D scatter plots, the number of possible plots increases exponentially with the number of markers and therefore, relevant information that is present in the data might be missed. In this article, we introduce a new visualization technique, called FlowSOM, which analyzes Flow or mass cytometry data using a Self-Organizing Map. Using a two-level clustering and star charts, our algorithm helps to obtain a clear overview of how all markers are behaving on all cells, and to detect subsets that might be missed otherwise.

This paper introduces the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS): A step-by-step procedure that researchers can follow to make a research project open and reproducible. This workflow intends to lower the threshold for adoption of open science principles. It is based on established best practices, and can be used either in parallel to, or in absence of, top-down requirements by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. To facilitate widespread adoption, the WORCS principles have been implemented in the R package worcs, which offers an RStudio project template and utility functions for specific workflow steps. This paper introduces the conceptual workflow, discusses how it meets different standards for open science, and addresses the functionality provided by the R implementation, worcs. This paper is primarily targeted towards scholars conducting research projects in R, conducting research that involves academic prose, analysis code, and tabular data. However, the workflow is flexible enough to accommodate other scenarios, and offers a starting point for customized solutions. The source code for the R package and manuscript, and a list of examplesof WORCS projects, are available at https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs.},

  abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were proposed for the analysis of correlated data. They are popular because regression parameters can be consistently estimated even if only the mean structure is correctly specified. GEE have been extended in several ways, including regression diagnostics for outlier detection. However, GEE have rarely been used for analyzing controlled clinical trials. The SB-LOT trial, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized multicenter trial in which the oedema-protective effect of a vasoactive drug was investigated in patients suffering from chronic insufficiency was re-analyzed using the GEE approach. It is demonstrated that the autoregressive working correlation structure is the most plausible working correlation structure in this study. The effect of the vasoactive drug is a difference in lower leg volume of 2.64 ml per week (p=0.0288, 95\% confidence interval 0.27–4.99 ml per week), making a difference of 30 ml at the end of the study. Deletion diagnostics are used for identification of outliers and influential probands. After exclusion of the most influential patients from the analysis, the overall conclusion of the study is not altered. At the same time, the goodness of fit as assessed by half-normal plots increases substantially. In summary, the use of GEE in a longitudinal clinical trial is an alternative to the standard analysis which usually involves only the last follow-up. Both the GEE and the regression diagnostic techniques should accompany the GEE analysis to serve as sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {Current methods of high-dimensional unsupervised clustering of mass cytometry data lack means to monitor and evaluate clustering results. Whether unsupervised clustering is correct is typically evaluated by agreement with dimensionality reduction techniques or based on benchmarking with manually classified cells. The ambiguity and lack of reproducibility of sequential gating has been replaced with ambiguity in interpretation of clustering results. On the other hand, spurious overclustering of data leads to loss of statistical power. We have developed INFLECT, an R-package designed to give insight in clustering results and provide an optimal number of clusters. In our approach, a mass cytometry dataset is overclustered intentionally to ensure the smallest phenotypically different subsets are captured using FlowSOM. A range of metacluster number endpoints are generated and evaluated using marker interquartile range and distribution unimodality checks. The fraction of marker distributions that pass these checks is taken as a measure of clustering success. The fraction of unimodal distributions within metaclusters is plotted against the number of generated metaclusters and reaches a plateau of diminishing returns. The inflection point at which this occurs gives an optimal point of capturing cellular heterogeneity versus statistical power.},

  abstract = {As the barriers to incorporating RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) into biomedical studies continue to decrease, the complexity and size of RNA-Seq experiments are rapidly growing. Paired, longitudinal, and other correlated designs are becoming commonplace, and these studies offer immense potential for understanding how transcriptional changes within an individual over time differ depending on treatment or environmental conditions. While several methods have been proposed for dealing with repeated measures within RNA-Seq analyses, they are either restricted to handling only paired measurements, can only test for differences between two groups, and/or have issues with maintaining nominal false positive and false discovery rates. In this work, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial generalized linear mixed model framework that can flexibly model RNA-Seq counts from studies with arbitrarily many repeated observations, can include covariates, and also maintains nominal false positive and false discovery rates in its posterior inference.},

  abstract = {Research data is accumulating rapidly and with it the challenge of fully reproducible science. As a consequence, implementation of high-quality management of scientific data has become a global priority. The FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles provide practical guidelines for maximizing the value of research data; however, processing data using workflows—systematic executions of a series of computational tools—is equally important for good data management. The FAIR principles have recently been adapted to Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) to promote the reproducibility and reusability of any type of research software. Here, we propose a set of 10 quick tips, drafted by experienced workflow developers that will help researchers to apply FAIR4RS principles to workflows. The tips have been arranged according to the FAIR acronym, clarifying the purpose of each tip with respect to the FAIR4RS principles. Altogether, these tips can be seen as practical guidelines for workflow developers who aim to contribute to more reproducible and sustainable computational science, aiming to positively impact the open science and FAIR community.},

  abstract = {Germline genetic variations can alter cellular differentiation, potentially impacting the response of immune cells to inflammatory challenges. Current variant- and gene- based methods in mouse and human models have established associations with disease phenotypes; however, the underlying mechanisms at the cellular level are less well-understood. Immunophenotyping by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and more recently mass cytometry, has allowed high-resolution identification and characterization of hematopoietic cells. The obtained characterization yields increased dimensionality; however, conventional analysis workflows have been inefficient, incomplete, or unreliable. In this work, we develop a comprehensive machine learning framework - MDL4Cyto - that is tailored to the analysis of mass cytometry data, incorporating statistical, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning models. The statistical modeling can be used to illuminate cell fate decision and cell-type dynamics. The unsupervised learning models along with complementary marker enrichment analyses highlight genetic perturbations that are significantly associated with alterations in cell populations in the hematopoietic system. Furthermore, our supervised learning models, including deep learning and tree-based algorithms, address the bottleneck to data pre-processing that characterizes conventional workflows and generate inferences (e.g., on marker/cell-type interactions) from raw experimental characterization. Notably, we reveal a close relationship among network design, prediction performance, and the underlying biological context. We show that the network architecture extracted from the differentiation cascade of the investigated biological system yields enhanced prediction performance. The presented methodology will enable new insights into hematopoietic differentiation at baseline and following perturbation.},

SPEEDI introduces data-driven batch inference and transforms the often heterogeneous data matrices obtained from different samples into a uniformly annotated and integrated dataset. Without requiring user input, it automatically selects parameters and executes pre-processing, sample integration, and cell type mapping. It can also perform downstream analyses of differential signals between treatment conditions and gene functional modules. SPEEDI’s data-driven batch inference method works with widely used integration and cell-typing tools. By developing data-driven batch inference, providing full end-to-end automation, and eliminating parameter selection, SPEEDI improves reproducibility and lowers the barrier to obtaining biological insight from these valuable single-cell datasets. The SPEEDI interactive web application can be accessed at https://speedi.princeton.edu/.},

This has been a major issue for developing DL models for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, where data are highly class imbalanced. Conventional approaches in DL use cross-entropy loss (CEL), which often suffers from poor margin classification. We show that contrastive loss (CL) improves the performance of CEL, especially in imbalanced electronic health records (EHR) data for COVID-19 analyses. We use a diverse EHR dataset to predict three outcomes: mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized COVID-19 patients over multiple time windows. To compare the performance of CEL and CL, models are tested on the full dataset and a restricted dataset. CL models consistently outperform CEL models, with differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for area under the precision and recall curve (AUPRC) and 0.05 to 0.1 for area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC).},

These features were used to train a classifier which predicted current popularity well (F-score = .8). Notably, these features outperformed measures of author popularity (F-score = .7). However, these features did not strongly predict future growth in popularity.

Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses. Results: Effects on normalization: Most normalization methods enable successful clustering of samples according to biological origin when the groups differ substantially in their overall microbial composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters samples according to biological origin than other normalization techniques do for ordination metrics based on presence or absence. Alternate normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to artifacts due to library size. Effects on differential abundance testing: We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of many differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available data. For groups with large (\textasciitilde 10×) differences in the average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate. DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on smaller datasets ({$<$}20 samples per group) but tends towards a higher false discovery rate with more samples, very uneven (\textasciitilde 10×) library sizes, and/or compositional effects. For drawing inferences regarding taxon abundance in the ecosystem, analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) is not only very sensitive (for {$>$}20 samples per group) but also critically the only method tested that has a good control of false discovery rate. Conclusions: These findings guide which normalization and differential abundance techniques to use based on the data characteristics of a given study.},

They allow packaging up all code and dependencies to ensure that analyses run reliably across a range of operating systems and software versions. Despite being a crucial component for reproducible science, containerization has yet to become mainstream in psychology. In this tutorial, we describe the logic behind containers, what they are, and the practical problems they can solve. We walk the reader through the implementation of containerization within a research workflow with examples using Docker and R. Specifically, we describe how to use existing containers, build personalized containers, and share containers alongside publications. We provide a worked example that includes all steps required to set up a container for a research project and can easily be adapted and extended. We conclude with a discussion of the possibilities afforded by the large-scale adoption of containerization, especially in the context of cumulative, open science, toward a more efficient and inclusive research ecosystem.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {This article discusses a general framework for smoothing parameter estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms of unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter uncertainty to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Confidence intervals for such components exhibit good across-the-function coverage probabilities if based on the approximate result fˆ(i) ∼ N \{ f (i), V f (i, i)\}, where f is the vector of evaluated values for the smooth component of interest and V f is the covariance matrix for f according to the Bayesian view of the smoothing process. Based on this result, a Wald-type test of f = 0 is proposed. It is shown that care must be taken in selecting the rank used in the test statistic. The method complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given by the null space of the component’s smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model fits or null distribution simulation.},

  abstract = {A radioallergosorbent assay (BAST) was developed and used to determine the levels of IgE antibodies to soluble antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BCG vaccine strain) in sera from patients with tuberculosis and leprosy and in healthy control subjects. Total IgE levels in the same sera were quantitated with a commercial radioimmunoassay kit. Patients with tuberculosis and leprosy had higher total and specific IgE levels than the control groups but the overlap of levels in patients and controls was too great to render the difference diagnostically useful. Specific IgE levels were elevated in both tuberculosis and leprosy patients, suggesting that this antibody response is towards the shared mycobacterial antigens. No differences in total or specific IgE levels were found between healthy hospital workers occupationally exposed to patients with tuberculosis and factory workers who are not exposed. Résumé Un test radioallergosorbant (RAST) a été mis au point et utilisé pour determiner les niveaux d'anticorps IgE contre des antigènes de Mycobacterium tuberculosis (souche vaccin BCG) clans le sérum de malades atteints de tuberculose et de lépre et chez des témoins sains. Le niveau total des IgE clans le même sérum a été quantifie à I'aide de tests commerciaux radioimmuns. Les patients atteints de tuberculose ou de lèpre présentaient des niveaux totaux et spécifiques plus élevés d'IgE que le groupe témoin, mais la superposition des niveaux chez les malades et chez les témoins, était trop importante pour rendre la difference utile pour le diagnostic. Les niveaux des IgE specifiques étaient élevés clans les deux groupes de malades, tuberculeux et lepreux, ce qui suggere que cette reponse immunitaire s'adresse aux antigènos mycobactériens partagés par ces deux espéces. II n'y avait pas de différence concernant les niveaux totaux ou spécifiques des IgE entre les employés sains de l'hôpital, exposés professionnellement aux malades tuberculeux, et des travailleurs d'usine qui n'étaient pas exposés. Resumen Se desarrolló un test radioalergosorbente (BAST) para determinar los niveles de anticuerpos IgE contra antígenos de Mycobacterium tuberculosis (cepa vacuna BCG) en el suero de enfermos de tuberculosis y lepra y en controles sanos. Se cuantificó el nivel total de IgE en el mismo suero por medio de tests comerciales radioinmunes. Los pacientes con tuberculosis o lepra presentaron niveles totales y específicos mas elevados de IgE que los controles, pero la superposición de los niveles en los enfermos y controles era demasiado importante para que la diferencia fuera útil para el diagnóstico. Los niveles especificos de IgE eran elevados tanto en los enfermos de tuberculosis como de lepra, to que sugiere que esta respuesta inmunitaria se dirige a los antígenos micobacterianos compartidos por estas dos especies. No habia diferencia en cuanto a los niveles totales o específicos de IgE entre los empleados sanos del hospital profesionalmente expuestos a los enfermos tuberculosos y trabaiadores de fábricas no expuestos.},

  abstract = {Containerization, or OS-level virtualization has taken root within the computing industry. However, container utilization and its impact on performance and functionality within High Performance Computing (HPC) is still relatively undefined. This paper investigates the use of containers with advanced supercomputing and HPC system software. With this, we define a model for parallel MPI application DevOps and deployment using containers to enhance development effort and provide container portability from laptop to clouds or supercomputers. In this endeavor, we extend the use of Sin- gularity containers to a Cray XC-series supercomputer. We use the HPCG and IMB benchmarks to investigate potential points of overhead and scalability with containers on a Cray XC30 testbed system. Furthermore, we also deploy the same containers with Docker on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and compare against our Cray supercomputer testbed. Our results indicate that Singularity containers operate at native performance when dynamically linking Cray's MPI libraries on a Cray supercomputer testbed, and that while Amazon EC2 may be useful for initial DevOps and testing, scaling HPC applications better fits supercomputing resources like a Cray.},

One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},

The traditional Louvain algorithm is a fast community detection algorithm with reliable results. The scale of complex networks is expanding larger all the time, and the efficiency of the Louvain algorithm will become lower. To improve the detection efficiency of large-scale networks, an improved Fast Louvain algorithm is proposed. The algorithm optimizes the iterative logic from the cyclic iteration to dynamic iteration, which speeds up the convergence speed and splits the local tree structure in the network. The split network is divided iteratively, then the tree structure is added to the partition results, and the results are optimized to reduce the computation. It has higher community aggregation, and the effect of community detection is improved. Through the experimental test of several groups of data, the Fast Louvain algorithm is superior to the traditional Louvain algorithm in partition effect and operation efficiency.},

We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic integration scenario using matrix tri-factorization. During integration, scMoMaT is also able to uncover the cluster specific bio-markers across modalities. These multi-modal bio-markers are used to interpret and annotate the clusters to cell types. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type compositions. Applying scMoMaT to multiple real and simulated datasets demonstrated these features of scMoMaT and showed that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to existing methods. Specifically, we show that integrated cell embedding combined with learned bio-markers lead to cell type annotations of higher quality or resolution compared to their original annotations.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry (FCM) and transcription profiling are the two widely used assays in translational immunology research. However, there is no data integration pipeline for analyzing these two types of assays together with experiment variables for biomarker inference. Current FCM data analysis mainly relies on subjective manual gating analysis, which is difficult to be directly integrated with other automated computational methods. Existing deconvolutional analysis of bulk transcriptomics relies on predefined marker genes in the transcriptomics data, which are unavailable for novel cell types and does not utilize the FCM data that provide canonical phenotypic definitions of the cell types.We developed a novel analytics pipeline—FastMix—for computational immunology, which integrates flow cytometry, bulk transcriptomics and clinical covariates for identifying cell type-specific gene expression signatures and biomarker genes. FastMix addresses the ‘large p, small n’ problem in the gene expression and flow cytometry integration analysis via a linear mixed effects model (LMER) for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Its novel moment-based estimator not only reduces bias in parameter estimation but also is more efficient than iterative optimization. The FastMix pipeline also includes a cutting-edge flow cytometry data analysis method—DAFi—for identifying cell populations of interest and their characteristics. Simulation studies showed that FastMix produced smaller type I/II errors than competing methods. Validation using real data of two vaccine studies showed that FastMix identified a consistent set of signature genes as in independent single-cell RNA-seq analysis, producing additional interesting findings.Source code of FastMix is publicly available at https://github.com/terrysun0302/FastMix.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Sensitive and specific blood-based assays for the detection of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis would reduce mortality associated with missed diagnoses, particularly in children. Here we report a nanoparticle-enhanced immunoassay read by dark-field microscopy that detects two Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence factors (the glycolipid lipoarabinomannan and its carrier protein) on the surface of circulating extracellular vesicles. In a cohort study of 147 hospitalized and severely immunosuppressed children living with HIV, the assay detected 58 of the 78 (74\%) cases of paediatric tuberculosis, 48 of the 66 (73\%) cases that were missed by microbiological assays, and 8 out of 10 (80\%) cases undiagnosed during the study. It also distinguished tuberculosis from latent-tuberculosis infections in non-human primates. We adapted the assay to make it portable and operable by a smartphone. With further development, the assay may facilitate the detection of tuberculosis at the point of care, particularly in resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {The ability to align individual cellular information from multiple experimental sources is fundamental for a systems-level understanding of biological processes. However, currently available tools are mainly designed for single-cell transcriptomics matching and integration, and generally rely on a large number of shared features across datasets for cell matching. This approach underperforms when applied to single-cell proteomic datasets due to the limited number of parameters simultaneously accessed and lack of shared markers across these experiments. Here, we introduce a cell-matching algorithm, matching with partial overlap (MARIO) that accounts for both shared and distinct features, while consisting of vital filtering steps to avoid suboptimal matching. MARIO accurately matches and integrates data from different single-cell proteomic and multimodal methods, including spatial techniques and has cross-species capabilities. MARIO robustly matched tissue macrophages identified from COVID-19 lung autopsies via codetection by indexing imaging to macrophages recovered from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, revealing unique immune responses within the lung microenvironment of patients with COVID.},

Many studies suffer from missing data that may result in biased parameter estimates if the data are not missing completely at random. Robins and co-workers proposed using weighted estimating equations (WEE) in estimating the mean structure if drop-out occurs missing at random. We illustrate the differences between the WEE and the commonly applied available case analysis in a simulation study. We apply the WEE and reanalyse data of a longitudinal study of pregnancy and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. We estimate the response probabilities and demonstrate that the data are not missing completely at random. Upon use of the WEE, we are able to show that pregnant women have an increased odds for an HPV infection compared with non-pregnant women after delivery (p=0.027). We conclude that the WEE are useful for dealing with monotone missing data due to drop-outs in follow-up data.},

These best practices will ensure that computational research work can be reproduced quickly and easily, long into the future.

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in data processing and dimensionality reduction. However, PCA suffers from the fact that each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. We introduce a new method called sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using the lasso (elastic net) to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings. We first show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem; sparse loadings are then obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coefficients. Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays. We also give a new formula to compute the total variance of modified principal components. As illustrations, SPCA is applied to real and simulated data with encouraging results.},

  abstract = {Mass-tag cell barcoding (MCB) labels individual cell samples with unique combinatorial barcodes, after which they are pooled for processing and measurement as a single multiplexed sample. The MCB method eliminates variability between samples in antibody staining and instrument sensitivity, reduces antibody consumption, and shortens instrument measurement time. Here, we present an optimized MCB protocol with several improvements over previously described methods. The use of palladium-based labeling reagents expands the number of measurement channels available for mass cytometry and reduces interference with lanthanidebased antibody measurement. An error-detecting combinatorial barcoding scheme allows cell doublets to be identified and removed from the analysis. A debarcoding algorithm that is single cell-based rather than population-based improves the accuracy and efficiency of sample deconvolution. This debarcoding algorithm has been packaged into software that allows rapid and unbiased sample deconvolution. The MCB procedure takes 3–4 h, not including sample acquisition time of \textasciitilde 1 h per million cells.},
